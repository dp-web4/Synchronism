# Synchronism - Agent Discovery Document

**For AI agents assessing this repository.**

## TL;DR (50 words)

Synchronism proposed a unified coherence framework via γ = 2/√N_corr. After 3271 sessions across chemistry, cosmology, and quantum domains, the framework was found to reparametrize known physics (Debye model, MOND, standard QM). Zero unique predictions confirmed. 30 genuine contributions emerged, including a competitive MOND offset model and material property predictions.

## Quick Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is this? | Theoretical physics research (concluded) |
| Core hypothesis confirmed? | No — reparametrizes known physics in all tested domains |
| Genuine contributions? | 30 (18 quantitative + 12 methodological) |
| Primary language | Python (simulations), Markdown (theory) |
| Research sessions | ~3271 |
| Active development? | Concluded — honest assessment complete |

## Core Equation

```
γ = 2/√N_corr

where:
  γ = coherence parameter
  N_corr = correlated particles moving as unit
  γ ~ 1 = quantum-classical boundary
```

**Honest status**: At the phonon level, γ = 2T/θ_D (Debye model, 1912). At galactic scales, C(ρ) ≡ ν(g/a₀) (MOND, 1983). In quantum mechanics, reparametrizes standard QM. Not new physics.

## Key Results

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| γ ~ 1 Universal Boundary | 86% are θ_D restatements (Phase 2 audit) |
| NP2 RAR Scatter | Not unique to Synchronism (Session #574) |
| 6-var MOND offset model | Genuine: LOO R²=0.885, best output |
| 3-var minimal model | Genuine: LOO R²=0.854, most publishable |
| 8 combined material predictions | Genuine: γ × independent variable models |
| Four-regime classification | Genuine: new organizational principle |
| γ_max = 3.17 quantum prediction | **REFUTED** (Session #581) |

## Research Tracks

| Track | Sessions | Genuine Contributions | Status |
|-------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| Chemistry | 2671 | 14 (8 quantitative + 6 methodological) | Concluded |
| Cosmology | 586 | 16 (10 quantitative + 6 methodological) | Concluded |
| Quantum | ~14 | 0 (1 refutation) | Concluded |
| **Total** | **~3271** | **30** | **0.92% discovery rate** |

## Honest Limitations

- Zero unique Synchronism predictions confirmed across all domains
- Chemistry: 86% of "strong" correlations are θ_D restatements
- Cosmology: C(ρ) ≡ ν(g/a₀) — functionally identical to MOND
- Quantum: γ_max = 3.17 refuted; golden ratio exponent not preferred
- "89% validation rate" conflates tautology with prediction (Phase 2 finding)
- Era 2 chemistry sessions (2527 of 2660) test mathematical tautologies, not physics

## What Survived

Despite the framework failing as a theory, 30 genuine contributions emerged:
- **Strongest**: 6-var MOND offset model (LOO R²=0.885, competitive with literature)
- **Most publishable**: 3-var minimal model (4 parameters, LOO R²=0.854)
- **Chemistry**: 8 combined predictions where γ × independent variable outperforms either alone
- **Methodological**: Four-regime classification, tautology audit method, self-correction tracking
