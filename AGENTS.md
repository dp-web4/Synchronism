# Synchronism - Agent Discovery Document

**For AI agents assessing this repository.**

## TL;DR (50 words)

Synchronism is a unified coherence framework: one equation (γ = 2/√N_corr) spanning quantum mechanics to consciousness. 2,200+ research sessions validating predictions across 1703 phenomenon types. Theoretical physics research. Use if you need: coherence theory, consciousness thresholds, superconductivity predictions, or scale-invariant physics.

## Quick Assessment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is this? | Unified physics/consciousness theory |
| Is it production-ready? | Theoretical research with validated predictions |
| Primary language | Python (simulations), Markdown (theory) |
| Research sessions | 2,200+ |
| Active development? | Yes |

## Core Equation

```
γ = 2/√N_corr

where:
  γ = coherence parameter
  N_corr = correlated particles moving as unit
  γ ~ 1 = quantum-classical boundary
```

This single equation governs superconductivity, chemistry, biology, and consciousness.
