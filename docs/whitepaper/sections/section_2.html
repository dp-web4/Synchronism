Systems</h2>
<p><strong>All Knowledge as Belief Systems</strong></p>
<p>Every framework for understanding reality—science, religion,
philosophy—is a belief system built on unprovable axioms. Science
assumes causality, repeatability, and mathematical describability.
Religion assumes divine purpose, moral order, or transcendent truth.
Philosophy assumes logical consistency and rational inquiry.</p>
<p>None of these axioms can be proven from first principles. They are
articles of faith that enable useful models.</p>
<p><strong>The Anthropocentric Axiom</strong></p>
<p>The most pervasive unexamined axiom in human knowledge is
anthropocentrism: the assumption that human perception, consciousness,
and observation are somehow fundamental to reality. This manifests
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Physics</strong>: The “observer” as a fundamental concept
(QM measurement, relativistic frames)</li>
<li><strong>In Philosophy</strong>: Consciousness as the primary mystery
requiring explanation</li>
<li><strong>In Religion</strong>: Human purpose or divine attention as
central</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronism challenges this axiom. What if reality operates entirely
independent of human (or any) observation? What if the “observer”
premise is the epicycle we’ve been preserving?</p>
<p><strong>Contextual Validity: The Elephant Parable</strong></p>
<p>The ancient parable of six blind men touching different parts of an
elephant—one feels a leg (pillar), another the trunk (rope), another the
ear (fan)—illustrates a key principle: each witness’s model is valid
<em>within their Markov Relevancy Horizon</em>.</p>
<p>The man touching the leg isn’t wrong about experiencing something
pillar-like. His model is complete and accurate for his interaction
boundary. He’s only wrong if he claims universal knowledge beyond his
MRH.</p>
<p><strong>Scale-Dependent Models</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism formalizes this: - <strong>Witnessing</strong>: Pattern
interaction within specific scales - <strong>MRH</strong>: The boundary
of relevant interaction for an entity - <strong>Abstraction</strong>:
Complexity management across scales</p>
<p>A cell’s “model” of its organism is different from the organism’s
“model” of itself—both valid at their scales. Neither has privileged
access to ultimate reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Paradigm Shift</strong></p>
<p>Anthropocentric science assumes a privileged “objective observer”
perspective exists—the view from nowhere that sees the whole
elephant.</p>
<p>Synchronism proposes: there is no whole elephant. Only pattern
interactions at various scales, each with bounded relevance. The
“complete picture” is itself an anthropocentric illusion—the desire for
God’s-eye view.</p>
<p>Reality isn’t a puzzle to be solved by combining perspectives. It’s
pattern dynamics at every scale, each valid within its MRH, none
fundamental.</p>
