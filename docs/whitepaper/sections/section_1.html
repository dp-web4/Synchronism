<p><strong>All Models Are Wrong</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism begins with a fundamental acknowledgment: all models of
reality are wrong. Science, religion, philosophy—each is a belief system
built on unprovable axioms. Synchronism itself is wrong. The question is
not “which model is true?” but “which model is less wrong for
understanding the mysteries that current frameworks cannot adequately
explain?”</p>
<p><strong>The Anthropocentric Premise</strong></p>
<p>All human knowledge systems share a common foundation: the
anthropocentric premise. Human science, from quantum mechanics to
relativity, places the “observer” as a fundamental concept. This is the
geocentric view of reality—humans at the center, with increasingly
complex mechanisms (epicycles) constructed to explain observed phenomena
while preserving the centrality of human observation.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropocentric Science (Geocentric View):</strong> -
Observer as fundamental to reality - Measurement “collapses” quantum
states - Observer-dependent simultaneity in relativity - Consciousness
as privileged or special - “Mysteries” requiring ever-more complex
explanations</p>
<p><strong>Synchronism (Heliocentric View):</strong> - Patterns cycle
independently of observation - Witnessing is synchronization with
existing cycles - No privileged observers—all entities are pattern
interactions - Consciousness as emergent pattern like any other -
“Mysteries” dissolve through paradigm shift, not added complexity</p>
<p>Just as heliocentrism didn’t refine epicycles but made them
irrelevant, Synchronism doesn’t refine observer-based physics—it makes
the observer premise itself secondary to pattern dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Intent as Computational Reification</strong></p>
<p>The key concept in Synchronism is “Intent”—a reification of the
abstract “greater force” for computational tractability. Intent is NOT
the force itself, nor is it ontologically real. It is a modeling
abstraction that makes the underlying dynamics computable and
testable.</p>
<p>Think of Intent as a variable in a computer program: it represents
something deeper (the “greater force”) but provides a framework we can
actually work with mathematically. This reification allows
quantification and prediction without claiming to describe ultimate
reality.</p>
<p><strong>Scope and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism proposes a non-anthropocentric foundation from which
quantum mechanics, relativity, consciousness, and other phenomena emerge
as observer-dependent interpretations. It is comprehensive in scope but
acknowledges its status as a model—a useful fiction that may be “less
wrong” than anthropocentric frameworks for certain mysteries.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Multiple Observers</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism models reality from a single reference frame—not because
there is a privileged observer, but because the model describes pattern
dynamics directly rather than through observer-dependent
measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern Dynamics vs. Observer Effects:</strong> -
Anthropocentric physics: Multiple observers with conflicting
measurements require reconciliation - Synchronism: Patterns cycle
independently; “observers” are just other patterns synchronizing</p>
<p><strong>Witnessing Without Observation:</strong> What anthropocentric
models call “observation” (implying consciousness and measurement
affecting reality), Synchronism calls “witnessing” (pattern
synchronization). A witness is itself an intent pattern interacting with
other patterns—not separate from reality, but part of the same pattern
dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>No Absolute Simultaneity Claim:</strong> Synchronism’s
single-frame approach is a modeling choice for computational
tractability, not a claim about absolute time. Observer-dependent
effects in relativity emerge at appropriate scales—they are real
measured phenomena. Synchronism simply proposes a deeper substrate where
these emerge from pattern dynamics rather than being fundamental.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations and Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The limitations of individual perspectives, as highlighted in the
parable of the blind men and the elephant, underscore the need for a
comprehensive model like Synchronism that strives for a holistic
understanding of reality. However, Synchronism acknowledges the
practical usefulness of limited-perspective analysis.</p>
<p>This is addressed with concepts like <a href="#mrh">Markov Relevancy
Horizon</a>, <a href="#abstraction">Abstraction</a>, <a
href="#witness-effect">Witness</a> and Experience as part of the
Synchronism model. These tools are not replacements for traditional
scientific methods but extensions that accommodate multi-scale coherence
and fractal analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formalism</strong></p>
<p>For Synchronism to be a useful and relevant model, it is necessary to
introduce formal mathematical treatments for its key concepts. The
mathematical approach combines discrete dynamics (for grid-based intent
transfer), differential equations (for field effects), and information
theory (for coherence measures). In order to keep the core document as
concise as possible, the complete mathematical formalism is introduced
separately in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>
