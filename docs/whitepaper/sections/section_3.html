Principles</h2>
<p>Synchronism aligns with and expands upon the seven Hermetic
principles, which are derived from the teachings attributed to Hermes
Trismegistus. These principles form the basis of Hermetic philosophy and
have influenced various esoteric and mystical traditions. Synchronism
builds upon these principles, offering a more detailed and
scientifically-grounded explanation of their manifestation in the
universe.</p>
<p>The seven Hermetic principles and their relation to Synchronism
are:</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Mentalism: “The All is Mind; the Universe is
Mental.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The universe is modeled as a vast array
of interconnected “cells” that contain and transfer “intent,” which
manifests as patterns of force-like transfer at the Planck scale. The
model can also be viewed as a fundamental neural network, furthering the
mentalism connection through its pattern processing dynamics rather than
through consciousness or mental properties.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Correspondence: “As above, so below; as below, so
above.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The model proposes a fractal nature of
reality, where patterns repeat at different scales, from the quantum to
the cosmic.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Vibration: “Nothing rests; everything moves and
vibrates.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> All phenomena are described as patterns
of intent transfer, which can be seen as a form of vibration or
oscillation at the most fundamental level.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Polarity: “Everything is dual; everything has
poles.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The concept of resonance and dissonance
in the model reflects the principle of polarity, where entities resonate
constructively or destructively depending on coherence of their
overlapping intent structures.</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Rhythm: “Everything flows, out and in; everything has its
tides.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The model describes the universe as
evolving through discrete “ticks” of time, creating a rhythmic
progression of states.</p>
<p><strong>3.6 Cause and Effect: “Every cause has its effect; every
effect has its cause.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The transfer of intent between cells
and the resulting emergence of patterns and entities follows a causal
chain, with each state informing the next.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 Gender: “Gender is in everything; everything has its
masculine and feminine principles.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synchronism:</strong> The model incorporates this principle
through the emergence of complementary functions such as generation and
evaluation, which some traditions anthropomorphize as masculine and
feminine. This duality operates similarly to Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), where the universal neural network experiences itself
through generative processes that propose new intent patterns and
discriminative processes that select patterns through coherence
evaluation. The generative principle explores new intent distribution
patterns, while the discriminative principle evaluates these patterns
against existing stable configurations, with coherence serving as the
selection mechanism. This emergent property is seen as necessary for an
entity’s persistence and evolution, allowing for adaptation while
maintaining internal coherence. It’s present in all entities across
scales, not just those traditionally considered conscious, and reflects
ancient concepts like yin and yang. Interpretations of this principle
extend to all entities, from quantum scale to galactic scale.</p>
<p>The alignment of Synchronism with the Hermetic principles lays a
philosophical foundation for the model’s fundamental concepts. The
following sections will delve into these concepts, demonstrating how
they provide a mechanistic explanation for the Hermetic principles’
manifestations in the universe.</p>
