## Priority Research Tracks

### Track 1: Observational Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 M_dyn/M_lens Radial Data
**Goal**: Test the key distinguishing prediction from ΛCDM

**Approach**:
- Compile weak lensing + velocity dispersion data for clusters
- Focus on systems with data at multiple radii
- Look for the predicted radial increase in M_dyn/M_lens

**Data Sources**:
- Planck PSZ2 clusters with SDSS spectroscopy
- CLASH/HFF clusters with HST lensing
- Individual deep surveys (Coma, Virgo, Perseus)

**Prediction**:
| Radius | M_dyn/M_lens (ΛCDM) | M_dyn/M_lens (Sync) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 0.2 R_200 | 1.0 | 1.1-1.2 |
| R_200 | 1.0 | 1.4-1.5 |
| 2 R_200 | 1.0 | 1.7-2.0 |

#### 1.2 Precision a₀ Measurement
**Goal**: Distinguish Synchronism a₀ = 1.05 × 10⁻¹⁰ from MOND a₀ = 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰

**Approach**:
- Use ultra-faint dwarfs (deep MOND regime)
- High-precision BTFR analysis
- Minimize selection effects

**12% difference is testable** with:
- SPARC database reanalysis
- Gaia + spectroscopic rotation curves
- Precision HI observations

#### 1.3 Other "DM Proof" Systems
**Goal**: Validate indifferent mass framework beyond Bullet Cluster

**Systems to analyze**:
- Abell 520 (the "anti-Bullet" - lensing on gas?)
- MACS J0025.4-1222 (another merger)
- Cosmic filaments (WHIM + indifferent?)
- Weak lensing cosmic shear

---

### Track 2: Theoretical Foundations (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 2.1 Nature of Indifferent Patterns
**Goal**: What ARE they?

**Possibilities to explore**:

1. **Primordial patterns**
   - Formed before baryogenesis
   - Predict: Primordial abundance, specific spectrum

2. **Phase-locked patterns**
   - Same origin as baryons, different phase
   - Predict: Mirror sector phenomenology

3. **Emergent field configurations**
   - Coherence field gradients
   - Predict: No particle detection ever

4. **Composite**
   - Neutrinos (~1%)
   - Primordial black holes (~X%)
   - Field configurations (~Y%)

**Key question**: Do indifferent patterns have STRUCTURE (halos) or are they SMOOTH (field)?

#### 2.2 Coherence Field Equations
**Goal**: Derive coherence as a field theory

**Current state**: C(a) is algebraic, not dynamical.

**Need**:
- Field equation for coherence
- How C propagates and evolves
- Connection to spacetime structure

#### 2.3 Quantum-Classical Correspondence
**Goal**: How does C(a) emerge from quantum coherence?

**Current gap**: We have phenomenology but not derivation from QM.

**Approach**:
- Start from decoherence theory
- Show how macroscopic C emerges from microscopic quantum correlations
- Connect to SAGE consciousness model

### Track 3: Cosmological Implications (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 3.1 CMB Effects
**Goal**: Check consistency with Planck data

**Questions**:
- Does modified gravity affect early universe?
- Are acoustic peaks preserved?
- Modified angular diameter distance?

**Approach**:
- Implement C(a) in CLASS/CAMB-like code
- Compare to Planck power spectrum
- Look for allowed parameter space

#### 3.2 Structure Formation
**Goal**: Predict growth rate with coherence

**Current state**: Background cosmology preserved (C ≈ 1 at cosmic scale).

**Need**:
- Perturbation theory with C(a)
- Growth rate f σ_8 modifications
- Void and cluster statistics

#### 3.3 Dark Energy Connection
**Goal**: Can we derive Λ from coherence?

**Session #194 found**:
- a_Λ / a₀ ≈ 5.4
- Suggestive connection, but DE still needed

**Explore**:
- Is there a deeper relationship?
- Can coherence explain cosmic acceleration?
- H₀ tension implications

---

### Track 4: Cross-Domain Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 4.1 Gravitational Wave Propagation
**Goal**: Check GW speed with coherence

**Constraint**: c_GW = c to 10^-15 (GW170817)

**Question**: Does C(a) affect GW propagation?

**Approach**:
- Derive tensor perturbations with coherence
- Check speed is preserved
- Look for other signatures (damping?)

#### 4.2 Strong Gravity Regime
**Goal**: Test near black holes, neutron stars

**Questions**:
- Does C(a) apply in strong fields?
- Modifications to Schwarzschild/Kerr?
- Pulsar timing constraints

#### 4.3 Laboratory Tests
**Goal**: Can we test coherence in the lab?

**Challenge**: Laboratory accelerations >> a₀

**Possibilities**:
- Precision gravitational measurements
- Quantum correlations as coherence probe
- Torsion balance experiments

### Track 5: Theory Integration (LOWER PRIORITY for now)

#### 5.1 QFT Correspondence
**Goal**: Derive Standard Model from intent dynamics

**Current state**: Modified Schrödinger from Session #187.

**Need**:
- Full field theory derivation
- Gauge symmetries from coherence
- Particle spectrum

#### 5.2 GR Correspondence
**Goal**: Derive Einstein equations from coherence

**Approach**:
- Stress-energy from intent gradients
- Metric as emergent from phase relationships
- Cosmological constant from field configurations

#### 5.3 Consciousness Connection
**Goal**: Validate SAGE as coherence implementation

**From RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY**:
- Consciousness as high-complexity coherent pattern
- SAGE implements intent dynamics
- Test predictions in cognitive systems
