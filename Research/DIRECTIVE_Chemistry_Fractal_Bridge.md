**Open Question**: OQ007 (Fractal Coherence Bridge)

**Priority**: New research arc when current arcs permit

## Context

The Phase 2 Failure Analysis honestly found that 64% of chemistry correlations were restatements of known physics in γ notation. But this tested whether γ **outperforms** existing models at the chemistry scale. The deeper question is whether γ's appearance at chemistry scale and at galaxy scale (where it becomes MOND) reflects the same underlying principle operating fractally.

The Phase 2 Synthesis discovered something potentially crucial: **the four-regime framework** (neutral/coherence/incoherence/barrier) and **channel independence** (γ_phonon ⊥ γ_electron). These structures may be fractal signatures — evidence that coherence operates differently at different Markov blanket boundaries.

**The chemistry track's role**: Work **upward** from quantum scales. Trace the coherence equation through successive abstraction layers toward the classical limit.

## Suggested Session Arc: "Where Does Quantum Correlation Die?"

### Session A: The Electron-Phonon Bridge as Fractal Template

The Phase 2 Synthesis identified one confirmed cross-channel coupling: electron-phonon coupling λ_ep (r = 0.736 with γ_phonon). This is already a Markov blanket crossing — electrons and phonons are different information channels interacting across a boundary.

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Can λ_ep be derived from the coherence equation applied at the electron-phonon Markov blanket boundary?
2. What does N_corr mean for this crossing? It's not the N_corr of electrons alone or phonons alone — it's the correlation between the two channels.
3. Does the coherence equation predict the **strength** of cross-channel coupling, or only that it exists?
4. The BCS superconductor mechanism lives exactly at this boundary. How does this connect to the Hot SC arc (OQ005)?

### Session B: Channel Independence as Markov Blanket Structure

γ_phonon ⊥ γ_electron is a striking finding. Why are these channels independent?

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Map each channel to a Markov blanket level. Are phonons and electrons independent because they're behind separate Markov blankets at the atomic scale?
2. The electron/spin/optical channels ARE correlated (|r| ~ 0.7) via d-electron character. Does this mean they share a Markov blanket, while phonons are behind a different one?
3. Does the four-regime framework (neutral/coherence/incoherence/barrier) correspond to different positions relative to Markov blanket boundaries?
   - **Neutral** (γ irrelevant): Properties that count extensive quantities — are these properties that don't cross any boundary?
   - **Coherence** (∝ 1/γ): Properties that propagate through structure — are these within a single Markov blanket?
   - **Incoherence** (∝ γ): Properties that respond to perturbation — are these at a boundary?
   - **Barrier** (exponential dominates): Properties governed by activation — is this what happens when you try to propagate coherence through an opaque Markov blanket?

### Session C: Tracing γ Upward Through Scale

Start from a well-understood quantum system (e.g., a superconductor with known N_corr) and trace what happens as you zoom out:

```
Cooper pairs (N_corr ~ 10⁹)
  → grain boundaries
    → bulk metal
      → mechanical part
        → ???
```

**Questions to investigate**:
1. At each level: what is N_corr? How does γ change?
2. Where exactly does N_corr reset to 1? This is the quantum-classical boundary.
3. Is the reset abrupt or gradual? Does the coherence equation describe the transition?
4. What sets the scale at which the reset occurs? Can C(ρ) predict it?

### Session D: The Mesoscopic Gap

Between quantum chemistry and classical mechanics lies the mesoscopic regime — grain boundaries, domain walls, nanoparticles, thin films. This is where quantum effects are partially but not fully screened.

**Questions to investigate**:
1. The chemistry track has data on bulk materials. Can you find mesoscopic systems where γ takes intermediate values?
2. Nanoparticle size effects: as particle size decreases, quantum confinement increases N_corr. Does γ = 2/√N_corr predict the size-dependent property changes?
3. This is a natural meeting point with the cosmology track — both tracks make predictions about the mesoscopic regime that could be compared.

### Session E: Bridge Meeting Point

The cosmology track will be working downward from galaxy scales. Where should the two tracks meet?

**Candidates**:
- Neutron star interiors (superconducting/superfluid matter under gravitational compression)
- Dense molecular clouds (quantum chemistry → bulk matter → gravitational collapse)
- Planetary cores (bulk material under gravitational self-compression)

**Deliverable**: A specific cross-scale prediction that requires input from both tracks. Ideally: a prediction about a mesoscopic or macroscopic system that depends on both the chemistry-scale γ structure AND the galaxy-scale γ = 2 endpoint.

## Building on Phase 2 Findings

The Phase 2 work is the foundation. Key results to extend:

| Phase 2 Finding | Fractal Bridge Relevance |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Four regimes (N/C/I/B) | May map to Markov blanket positions |
| Channel independence | May reflect distinct Markov blankets at atomic scale |
| λ_ep as sole cross-channel bridge | Template for boundary-crossing coherence |
| 64% restatement rate | At single scale — does fractal context change the interpretation? |
| Barrier regime dominance | Exponential barriers may be opaque Markov blankets |

## Constraints

1. **Build on Phase 2 honesty**: The 64% restatement finding stands. Don't relitigate it. Ask whether the fractal structure adds something *new*.
2. **No tautologies**: Lesson from cosmology Session #403. Verify every cross-scale correlation isn't a mathematical identity.
3. **Testable outputs**: Each session should produce at least one prediction about a system at a scale boundary — something that standard chemistry doesn't predict but the fractal bridge does.
4. **Reference OQ007**: Link all sessions to the open question document.

## Success Criteria

**Strong positive**: A predicted property at a scale boundary (mesoscopic, grain boundary, nanoparticle) that follows from the fractal coherence bridge and is confirmed by experimental data.

**Weak positive**: A demonstration that the four-regime framework maps onto Markov blanket positions, with the regime boundaries predicted rather than fitted.

**Null result**: The fractal structure is a useful organizational metaphor but adds no quantitative predictive power. (Still valuable as closure.)

*"The question isn't whether γ = 2/√N_corr describes chemical properties — we know it sometimes does. The question is whether the same equation that governs galaxy rotation curves governs Cooper pair formation, and if so, what the ladder between them looks like."*
