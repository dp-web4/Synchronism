# Social Coherence Research Track

**Status**: Early Exploration
**Date Started**: January 15, 2026
**Origin**: Thor autonomous session
**Key Hypothesis**: Trust networks follow coherence dynamics

---

## Purpose

Apply the validated coherence framework (γ = 2/√N_corr) to social trust network dynamics. Test whether the same physics governing quantum and material systems also governs social phenomena.

---

## Theoretical Basis

From established Synchronism sessions:
- **Session #259**: Everything is coherence (ontological identity)
- **Session #24**: S/S₀ = γ/2 validated universally (r=0.994, p<10⁻²¹)
- **Session #33**: Effective dimensionality d_eff << d_spatial
- **Session #34**: α saturation in multi-component systems

## Predictions

| ID | Prediction | Test Method |
|----|------------|-------------|
| P_THOR_1 | Network average trust correlates with coherence C | Apply C(T) formula to trust data |
| P_THOR_2 | Trust variance follows S/S₀ = γ/2 relation | Measure variance vs coherence |
| P_THOR_3 | Coalition formation at mutual trust > 0.5 | Analyze web4 simulation data |
| P_THOR_4 | Effective network dimension d_eff < d_spatial | Compute coupling structure |
| P_THOR_5 | Trust cascades show soliton-like propagation | Analyze temporal dynamics |

## Current Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `trust_coherence_analyzer.py` | Analysis tool for trust network data |
| `trust_coherence_analysis.json` | Results from initial analysis |

## Data Source

Trust network data from web4 multi-agent simulation:
- Agent trust relationships
- Coalition formation dynamics
- Network evolution over time

---

## Open Questions

1. **Validation status**: Do predictions hold on web4 data?
2. **Domain modifications**: What social-specific adjustments needed?
3. **Scale mapping**: What is N_corr in social context?
4. **Phase transitions**: Is coalition formation a coherence phase transition?

## Connection to Framework

If predictions validate:
- Extends coherence framework to social networks
- Provides quantitative model for trust dynamics
- Bridges physics → sociology

If predictions fail:
- Identifies domain-specific limitations
- Informs framework boundaries
- Either outcome advances understanding
