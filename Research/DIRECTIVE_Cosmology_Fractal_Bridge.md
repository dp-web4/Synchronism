# Cosmology Track Directive: Fractal Bridge — Work Downward

**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Open Question**: OQ007 (Fractal Coherence Bridge)
**Reference**: `OPEN_QUESTION_Fractal_Coherence_Bridge.md`
**Priority**: New research arc when current arcs permit

## Context

The self-audit (Sessions #574-587) correctly found that C(ρ) at the galaxy scale is equivalent to MOND's interpolation function. But this tested the equation **at one scale in isolation**. The deeper Synchronism claim is fractal self-similarity: the same coherence equation operates at every Markov blanket boundary, with γ = 2/√N_corr encoding the correlation structure. At galaxy scale, N_corr = 1 and γ = 2 — which is why it looks identical to MOND. The question is whether this is coincidence or the γ=2 special case of a universal principle.

**The cosmology track's role**: Work **downward** from the galaxy scale. Ask why γ = 2 here specifically, and what would change at adjacent scales.

## Suggested Session Arc: "Why γ = 2 Here?"

### Session A: Stars as Markov Blankets

Stars are thermalized systems. Their internal quantum correlations (electron degeneracy, nuclear fusion, plasma physics) are hidden behind a Markov blanket — the photosphere. From the galaxy's perspective, a star is a classical point mass. This is why N_corr = 1 at the galactic scale.

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Can this be formalized? Define the stellar Markov blanket in information-theoretic terms. What information is lost at the photosphere boundary?
2. What is the information-theoretic cost of this abstraction? Does it relate to γ?
3. What would N_corr > 1 mean at galactic scale? (Correlated stellar motion — binary stars? Star clusters? Tidal streams?)
4. For binary stars: does the binary system act as a single unit with N_corr = 2, predicting γ = √2 ≈ 1.41? Is there any testable consequence?

### Session B: Neutron Stars — Where the Blanket Thins

Neutron stars are a natural test case: their interiors have quantum correlations (neutron superfluidity, proton superconductivity) that extend to macroscopic scales. The Markov blanket is less opaque.

**Questions to investigate**:
1. For a neutron star, what is N_corr? Superfluid neutrons form Cooper pairs extending over ~10-100 fm — what's the effective correlation unit?
2. Does the coherence equation predict anything about neutron star dynamics (glitches, cooling curves) that differs from standard nuclear physics?
3. This is where the chemistry track's superconductor analysis (OQ005, η formalism) directly connects — the same physics of Cooper pair coherence.

### Session C: The Continuum Limit

Between "quantum chemistry" and "classical stellar dynamics" lies a vast hierarchy of scales. Where does classical behavior emerge?

**Questions to investigate**:
1. Can the coherence equation predict the scale at which quantum correlations become negligible (the quantum-classical boundary)?
2. Is ρ_crit related to the density at which this transition occurs?
3. The chemistry track found four regimes (neutral/coherence/incoherence/barrier). Does the "barrier regime" correspond to a Markov blanket boundary where coherence cannot propagate?

### Session D: Bridge Meeting Point

The chemistry track will be working upward from quantum scales. Identify where the two tracks should meet.

**Candidates**:
- Grain boundaries in metals (mesoscopic quantum effects → classical bulk)
- Planetary interiors (bulk matter → gravitational dynamics)
- Dense molecular clouds (chemistry → star formation → stellar dynamics)

**Deliverable**: A specific cross-scale prediction that requires input from both tracks.

## Constraints

1. **Honesty first**: If the fractal bridge turns out to be metaphorical rather than mathematical, say so. The self-audit tradition must continue.
2. **No tautologies**: Session #403's lesson. Check every correlation for mathematical identity before claiming physical content.
3. **Testable outputs**: Each session should produce at least one falsifiable prediction, even if testing it requires data from the chemistry track or external sources.
4. **Reference OQ007**: Link all sessions to the open question document.

## Success Criteria

**Strong positive**: A prediction that requires the fractal hierarchy — something the galaxy-scale equation alone cannot produce — and is confirmed or confirmable.

**Weak positive**: A demonstration that the Markov blanket boundaries between scales are consequences of the coherence equation rather than inputs.

**Null result**: The fractal structure is mathematically consistent but adds no predictive power beyond what each scale provides independently. (This is still a valuable finding.)

*"The question isn't whether C(ρ) matches MOND at galaxy scale — we know it does. The question is whether that match is the γ=2 endpoint of a ladder that starts in quantum chemistry."*
