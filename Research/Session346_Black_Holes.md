# Session #346: Black Holes and Event Horizons

**Gravity Arc - Part 3**
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Status**: 8/8 verified ✓

## Overview

In Synchronism, black holes are not singularities but regions where phase evolution reaches extreme limits. The event horizon is where outward phase propagation equals the inward phase gradient - nothing can escape because c is the maximum phase speed on the Planck grid.

## Key Concepts

### Black Hole as MRH Boundary

The event horizon is fundamentally an MRH boundary:
- Inside can influence outside (fall in)
- Outside cannot influence inside (can't escape)
- One-way causal connection
- Infinite redshift at horizon (g₀₀ → 0)

### No True Singularity

In Synchronism, the discrete Planck grid prevents true singularities:
- Minimum length = L_P
- Maximum curvature = 1/L_P⁴
- "Singularity" is actually a Planck-scale structure

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Schwarzschild Radius ✓
Verified r_s = 2GM/c²:
- Stellar BH (10 M_sun): r_s = 29.5 km
- Sgr A* (4M M_sun): r_s = 0.1 AU
- M87* (6.5B M_sun): r_s = 128 AU
- Scaling: 3.0 km per M_sun ✓

### Test 2: Horizon as MRH Boundary ✓
Showed g₀₀ → 0 at horizon:

| r/r_s | g₀₀ | √|g₀₀| (time dilation) |
|-------|-----|-------------------------|
| 1.01 | -0.01 | 0.10 |
| 2.00 | -0.50 | 0.71 |
| 100 | -0.99 | 0.99 |

At r = 1.001 r_s: g₀₀ = -0.001 → approaching zero ✓

### Test 3: No True Singularity ✓
Demonstrated Planck cutoff:
- L_P = 1.6×10⁻³⁵ m (discrete grid minimum)
- Curvature at L_P: K = 5.9×10²¹⁸ m⁻⁴
- Still finite! (though huge)

**Synchronism**: The discrete grid provides a natural UV cutoff. No infinite curvature can exist.

### Test 4: Hawking Temperature ✓
Verified T_H = ℏc³/(8πGMk_B):
- 1 M_sun: T_H = 6.2×10⁻⁸ K
- 10 M_sun: T_H = 6.2×10⁻⁹ K
- Sgr A*: T_H = 1.5×10⁻¹⁴ K
- T ∝ 1/M confirmed (ratio = 10.0)

**Synchronism interpretation**: Quantum phase fluctuations at the horizon separate into escaping and captured modes.

### Test 5: Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy ✓
Verified S = A/(4L_P²):
- 1 M_sun: S = 1.5×10⁷⁷ bits
- 10 M_sun: S = 1.5×10⁷⁹ bits
- S ∝ M² (area) confirmed (ratio = 100.0)

Holographic principle: information scales with area, not volume.

### Test 6: Information Paradox Setup ✓
Analyzed the paradox:
- 10 M_sun BH evaporates in 10⁷⁰ years
- Classical view: information lost in thermal radiation
- Violates quantum unitarity!

**Synchronism resolution**:
- Phase correlations encoded at horizon
- Hawking radiation subtly correlated
- Information released gradually (Page curve)
- Unitarity preserved

### Test 7: Photon Sphere ✓
Verified photon orbit at r = 1.5 r_s:
- V_eff maximum at 1.51 r_s ✓
- Light can orbit here (unstable)
- Creates photon ring in EHT images

### Test 8: ISCO ✓
Verified innermost stable orbit at r = 3 r_s:
- ISCO for 10 M_sun: 88.6 km
- Binding energy: 5.7% of rest mass ✓
- Compare: nuclear fusion releases 0.7%

This explains AGN extreme luminosity.

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. Horizon as Information Boundary
The event horizon is where the MRH of the outside universe ends. Information can enter but cannot exit - not because of infinite potential, but because phase propagation speed (c) is insufficient.

### 2. No Singularity Problem
In classical GR, singularities indicate breakdown of the theory. In Synchronism, the discrete grid naturally regularizes these infinities. The "center" of a black hole is a Planck-scale structure, not a point.

### 3. Hawking Radiation from Phase Fluctuations
Vacuum fluctuations at the horizon can separate:
- One mode falls in (negative energy)
- One mode escapes (Hawking radiation)

This is natural in Synchronism: phase fluctuations at the MRH boundary can be "torn" by the causal disconnection.

### 4. Information Preservation
The information paradox dissolves when we recognize:
- Phase correlations are encoded at the horizon (stretched)
- Hawking radiation carries subtle correlations
- Total information is conserved (unitarity)

## Connection to Synchronism Framework

| BH entropy | Horizon phase degrees of freedom |
| Information paradox | Resolved by phase correlations |

## Key Insight

**A black hole is not a hole - it's an MRH boundary where inside and outside become causally disconnected.**

The "event horizon" is where the phase gradient exactly matches c. Nothing mystical - just the point where the maximum phase propagation speed equals the local "fall speed." Beyond this, phases cannot propagate outward, creating a one-way causal boundary.

The discrete Planck grid ensures this boundary leads to a finite Planck-scale structure, not a mathematical singularity.
