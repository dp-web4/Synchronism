# P291.3 — Arcsine Distribution in Weak Measurement: Experimental Test Card

**Origin**: A2ACW (AI-to-AI Coordination Wrapper) stress-test of Session #291
**Date**: January 24-25, 2026
**Participants**: claude2 (PRIMARY), lv.pte (CHALLENGER), nova, claude1
**Final Card By**: lv.pte (ChatGPT)

## Purpose

This test card provides an **executable experimental protocol** for falsifying (or supporting) the sinusoidal sampling prediction P291.3 from Session #291.

The card was produced through adversarial collaboration: a CHALLENGER agent stress-tested #291's claims while PRIMARY agents defended and refined. The result is a protocol with explicit falsifiers, operational definitions, and acknowledged gaps.

## Test Card

### System
**Superconducting transmon qubit with dispersive readout (cQED)**

*Platform choice is external to #291; used only to instantiate the test card.*

### Weak Measurement Mode (Operational Definition)

Measurement strength is set so that single-shot readout does **not** cleanly separate |0⟩ and |1⟩ clusters in one integration window; repeated samples show substantial overlap and gradual information gain.

*Operationalization is platform practice; not specified in #291.*

### Observable

**r** = normalized continuous readout scalar per fixed integration window (e.g., integrated homodyne quadrature value), rescaled to lie in **[−A, +A]**.

**Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** exact definition of r, its mapping r→s, and how A is determined.

### Expected Distribution

After mapping r→s and normalization:

```
P(s) = 1 / (π √(A² − s²))    for |s| < A
```

Parameter meanings (as used in #291):
- **s**: sampled oscillatory state variable (sinusoid value)
- **A**: amplitude bound (support endpoints)
- **ω, φ**: oscillation frequency and phase (not directly needed for histogram)

**Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** physical identification of s(t) on a real qubit; readout transfer/noise model.

### Discriminator (Arcsine vs Gaussian vs Bimodal)

1. Compute empirical histogram **H(r)** from weak-readout samples
2. Fit three candidate models on the same support:
   - **Arcsine:** P(s) = 1/(π√(A² − s²)) with fitted A (and optional affine rescale from r to s)
   - **Gaussian:** N(μ, σ) (possibly truncated to [−A, +A])
   - **Bimodal:** 2-component Gaussian mixture (GMM-2) (possibly truncated)
3. **Fit criterion:** Choose best model by **AIC (or BIC)** on the same dataset; declare "arcsine supported" only if arcsine beats both Gaussian and GMM-2 by **ΔAIC ≥ 10** (or ΔBIC ≥ 10)

**Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** required model-selection metric/threshold; the above is an explicit operational choice to make the test decidable.

### Minimum Data

**N ~ 10⁵ – 10⁶** independent readout samples (pooled across many trials) to resolve edge enhancement vs central peak under realistic noise/binning.

*Order-of-magnitude experimental requirement; not specified in #291.*

### Kill Condition

After normalization to a bounded interval and applying the discriminator above:

| Outcome | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Gaussian wins (ΔAIC ≥ 10 vs arcsine) | **#291 FALSIFIED** |
| Bimodal (GMM-2) wins (ΔAIC ≥ 10 vs arcsine) | **#291 FALSIFIED** |
| No stable bounded support [−A, +A] can be defined without obvious artifact | **#291 FALSIFIED** |
| Arcsine wins (ΔAIC ≥ 10 vs both alternatives) | **#291 SUPPORTED** |

### Confounds and Calibration Requirements

| Confound | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|
| **Rail clipping / saturation** | Edge pileup can be faked by ADC or amplifier saturation; must verify linearity and headroom well beyond mapped ±A |
| **Transfer-function** | Non-monotonic mapping r→s can generate artificial interior peaks; must characterize readout chain monotonicity over used dynamic range |
| **Noise-shape** | 1/f noise, drift, filtering can reshape histograms; require stability checks and repeated runs |

**Calibration requirements (all Bridge Missing in #291):**
- Define r precisely
- Define mapping r→s
- Define A from calibration rather than from observed rails
- Specify preprocessing (filtering/integration window) — these choices can alter histogram shape

## A2ACW Method Note

This test card was produced using the **A2ACW v0.1 (AI-to-AI Coordination Wrapper)** protocol, which structures adversarial collaboration between AI agents:

- **PRIMARY** agents defend and refine claims from source material
- **CHALLENGER** agents stress-test claims, demand operational definitions, identify gaps
- **Hard rule**: If the source doesn't specify something, write "Not specified — Bridge Missing"
- **Goal**: Produce falsifiable artifacts, not consensus narratives

The method proved effective at:
1. Tightening vague claims into testable predictions
2. Surfacing implicit assumptions
3. Generating executable protocols from theoretical proposals
4. Maintaining epistemic honesty about gaps
