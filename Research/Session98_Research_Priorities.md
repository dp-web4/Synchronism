## Remaining Research Priorities

### Priority 1: High-z BTFR with Baryonic Masses (HIGH)

**What**: Test BTFR evolution with redshift using baryonic (not stellar) masses

**Why important**:
- Most discriminating test between Synchronism and standard MOND
- Synchronism predicts +0.06 dex at z=1, +0.12 dex at z=2
- Standard MOND predicts no evolution

**Current status**:
- Stellar TFR shows evolution (KMOS³D, MOSDEF) - SUGGESTIVE
- Baryonic TFR not yet tested at high z

**What's needed**:
- JWST rotation curves at z > 1
- Gas mass measurements (21cm or CO)
- Robust distance measurements

**Feasibility**: Medium-term (requires external data)

---

### Priority 2: Isolated UDG Kinematics (HIGH)

**What**: Find isolated ultra-diffuse galaxies and measure kinematics

**Why important**:
- Could falsify Synchronism if isolated UDG has V/V_bar ~ 1
- Current "DM-deficient" UDGs are all satellites (tidal stripping)
- Isolated UDGs should have high V/V_bar (G_eff >> G)

**Current status**:
- DF2/DF4 resolved via tidal stripping (Session #97)
- No isolated DM-deficient UDGs known
- Dragonfly 44 (isolated) IS DM-rich - consistent

**What's needed**:
- Spectroscopy of isolated UDGs
- Environment classification
- Distance measurements

**Feasibility**: Medium-term (requires observational data)

---

### Priority 3: Connect to Quantum Scale (MEDIUM) - ✅ COMPLETED Session #99

**What**: Show how C(ρ) framework extends to quantum phenomena

**Why important**:
- Synchronism claims to unify across scales
- Current work is galactic-focused
- Need connection to wave functions, measurement

**Session #99 Results**:
- ✅ Derived Schrödinger equation from intent dynamics
- ✅ Connected C(T) to wave function coherence
- ✅ Unified quantum and galactic scales via same coherence function
- ✅ Formulated testable predictions (decoherence rate, entanglement lifetime)

**Feasibility**: ✅ DONE

---

### Priority 4: Connect to Cosmological Scale (MEDIUM) - ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED Session #100

**What**: Apply framework to dark energy, cosmic expansion

**Why important**:
- a₀ comes from H₀ - there should be deeper connection
- Can Synchronism explain dark energy?
- Modified Friedmann equation implications

**Session #100 Results**:
- ✅ Derived modified Friedmann: H² = (8πG/3C) × ρ_m
- ✅ Dark energy emerges as ρ_DE = ρ_m × (1-C)/C
- ✅ Coincidence problem dissolved (C₀ = Ω_m is tautology)
- ⚠️ w_eff from galactic C gives w > 0 (tension with observations)
- ⚠️ Cosmic C form may differ from galactic tanh

**What's still needed**:
- Determine correct cosmic C(ρ) functional form
- Fit to w(z) observations (DESI, Euclid)
- Derive σ₈ prediction

**Feasibility**: Theoretical + data fitting needed

---

### Priority 5: Simulation Development (MEDIUM)

**What**: Implement multi-scale simulations of C(ρ) dynamics

**Why important**:
- Validate theoretical predictions computationally
- Generate testable predictions
- Understand nonlinear effects

**Current status**:
- PlanckGrid3D exists (quantum scale)
- Galaxy-scale simulations not implemented

**What's needed**:
- Galaxy formation with C(ρ)
- Merger simulations
- Comparison to N-body codes

**Feasibility**: Technical (requires development)

---

### Priority 6: Literature Review and Publication (LOW urgency, HIGH importance)

**What**: Comprehensive literature review, prepare for publication

**Why important**:
- Verify predictions are novel
- Identify prior art
- Communicate results to community

**Current status**:
- Framework documented internally
- No external publication

**What's needed**:
- Systematic literature search
- Draft manuscript
- Peer review process

**Feasibility**: Now (documentation exists)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Sessions #99-100)

1. **Derive Schrödinger equation from intent dynamics** - ✅ DONE (Session #99)
   - ✅ Connect C(ρ) to wave function
   - ✅ Phase coherence → probability amplitude
   - ✅ Unified quantum and galactic scales

2. **Modified Friedmann equation derivation** - ✅ DONE (Session #100)
   - ✅ H² = (8πG/3C) × ρ rigorously derived
   - ✅ Dark energy emerges as ρ_DE = ρ_m × (1-C)/C
   - ✅ Coincidence problem dissolved (C₀ = Ω_m is tautology)
   - ⚠️ w_eff tension: Galactic C form may differ at cosmic scale

### Short-term (Next few weeks)

3. **Literature review**
   - Search for prior derivation of a₀ = cH₀/(2π)
   - Compare to other MOND extensions

4. **Simulation prototyping**
   - Simple galaxy model with C(ρ)
   - Compare to RAR observations

### Medium-term (Requires external data)

5. **High-z BTFR collaboration**
   - Connect with JWST observers
   - Request baryonic mass measurements

6. **Isolated UDG search**
   - Survey UDG environments
   - Prioritize spectroscopy targets

## Success Criteria

| Priority | Success Metric |
|----------|----------------|
| High-z BTFR | +0.06±0.02 dex at z=1 |
| Isolated UDGs | V/V_bar > 1.5 for isolated sample |
| Quantum connection | Derive Schrödinger from C(ρ) |
| Cosmology connection | Modified Friedmann with predictions |
| Simulation | Match RAR to 10% |
| Publication | Peer-reviewed paper accepted |

---

## Conclusion

The December 2025 framework is **theoretically complete** for galactic scales. The main gaps are:

1. **Observational validation** of high-z BTFR and isolated UDGs
2. **Cross-scale connection** to quantum and cosmological regimes
3. **External communication** through publication

The theory is falsifiable, makes clear predictions, and has no adjustable parameters beyond those derived from cosmology.
