## Executive Summary

Session #113 analyzes whether Synchronism's scale-dependent coherence can explain the Hubble tension. **Key finding: Synchronism does NOT resolve the Hubble tension.** This is an important negative result that demonstrates the theory's honesty and testability.

### Key Results

| Tension | Synchronism Resolution? | Reason |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| S8 tension | ✓ YES | G_local < G_global at z ~ 0.5-1.5 |
| H0 tension | ✗ NO | CMB and local calibrators both use C ~ 1 |

## Part 1: The Hubble Tension

### Current Status

| Method | H0 (km/s/Mpc) | σ | Type |
|--------|---------------|---|------|
| Planck CMB | 67.4 | 0.5 | Early universe |
| SH0ES Cepheids | 73.0 | 1.0 | Local |
| TRGB | 69.8 | 1.7 | Local |
| Megamasers | 73.9 | 3.0 | Geometric |
| BAO + BBN | 67.6 | 1.0 | Early + z~0.5 |
| Strong lensing | 73.3 | 1.8 | Time delays |

### The Pattern

- **Early universe methods**: H0 ~ 67-68 km/s/Mpc
- **Late universe methods**: H0 ~ 72-74 km/s/Mpc
- **Tension**: 5.0σ (highly significant)

## Part 2: Can Synchronism Help?

### The Question

Does scale-dependent coherence (G_eff = G/C) affect H0 measurements differently at early vs late times?

### Analysis: CMB Measurements

At recombination (z = 1089):
```
C_galactic = 1.0000
C_cosmic = 1.0000
G_ratio = 1.0000
```

**Finding**: At z >> 1, there is NO scale-dependent coherence effect.
- CMB physics is standard
- Sound horizon is unchanged
- CMB-derived H0 is correct

### Analysis: Local Measurements

Local H0 uses the distance ladder:
1. **Parallax** → Geometry (not affected by gravity)
2. **Cepheid P-L** → Stellar physics (C ~ 1 in stellar interiors)
3. **SNe Ia** → Thermonuclear (C ~ 1 in WD explosions)
4. **Hubble flow** → Standard cosmology

**Finding**: All steps use high-density environments where C ~ 1.
- Stellar interiors have ρ >> ρ_cosmic
- C approaches 1 in dense environments
- Distance ladder is robust

## Part 3: Why Synchronism Doesn't Help

### Reason 1: CMB is Unaffected

At z = 1089, C_cosmic = C_galactic = 1.0

The early universe has no scale-dependent coherence because:
- Matter density dominated (Ω_m(z=1089) ≈ 1)
- Coherence transitions hadn't occurred yet
- Physics is standard GR

### Reason 2: Local Calibrators Use High-Density Regions

| Calibrator | Environment | C value |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Cepheid interior | ρ ~ 10^15 ρ_cosmic | ~1.0 |
| SNe Ia (WD) | ρ ~ 10^9 ρ_cosmic | ~1.0 |
| Galaxies | ρ ~ 10^6 ρ_cosmic | ~1.0 |

All local calibrators feel standard gravity (G_eff ≈ G).

### Reason 3: Natural Calibration Preserves H0

Session #72 established that C_0 = Ω_m = 0.315 is the natural calibration.

This makes:
```
H_Sync(z=0) = H_LCDM(z=0) = H0
```

The Hubble constant is preserved by construction.

## Part 4: Implications

### What This Means

1. **S8 and H0 tensions may be INDEPENDENT**
   - Different physics at different epochs
   - Synchronism addresses one but not both

2. **This is a STRENGTH, not a weakness**
   - Synchronism doesn't overfit
   - Theory makes clear, falsifiable predictions
   - Not everything is explained by one mechanism

3. **If S8 and H0 are later shown to be connected**
   - Synchronism would need revision
   - This is a genuine test

### What Could Resolve H0 Tension?

Possibilities (outside Synchronism):
- Early dark energy
- Modified recombination physics
- New physics at z > 1000
- Systematic errors in measurements

## Part 5: Comparison of Tensions

| Property | S8 Tension | H0 Tension |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Significance | ~3σ | ~5σ |
| Epoch | z ~ 0.5-1.5 | z = 0 vs z = 1089 |
| Synchronism? | RESOLVED | NOT RESOLVED |
| Physics | Late-time growth | Sound horizon vs local |
| G_ratio effect | Yes (< 1) | No (= 1 both places) |

---

## Part 6: Updated Prediction Table

| Observable | Synchronism Prediction | Status |
|------------|----------------------|--------|
| S8 | 0.78 (not 0.83) | ✓ Matches lensing |
| fσ8 | 10% lower | ✓ Some hints |
| A_ISW | 1.23 (23% higher) | ~ Marginal |
| Cluster counts | 35% fewer | ✓ Matches observed |
| **H0** | **NO PREDICTION** | Theory-independent |

**Synchronism is silent on H0 tension** - this is honest.

## Conclusion

Session #113 demonstrates an important negative result:

**Synchronism does NOT resolve the Hubble tension.**

This is because:
1. CMB physics (z = 1089) has G_ratio = 1.0
2. Local calibrators use high-density regions (C ~ 1)
3. Both early and late measurements feel standard gravity

**This is actually a feature, not a bug:**
- Synchronism doesn't overfit
- Theory has clear scope and limits
- S8 and H0 may be independent puzzles
- Falsifiable prediction: if they're connected, theory needs revision

---

*"A theory that explains everything explains nothing. Synchronism's failure to address H0 while succeeding with S8 suggests genuine, testable physics."*
