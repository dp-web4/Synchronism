## Current Framework Status

### Validated Predictions
| Prediction | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| P1.1: BCS gap ratio | VALIDATED | <1% error |
| P3.2: Hückel's rule | VALIDATED | Exact match |
| P2.4: KIE-γ correlation | STRONG | r = -0.978 |

### Falsified Predictions
| Prediction | Status | Issue |
|------------|--------|-------|
| P4.2: Melting point model | FAILED | 53% error, needs cohesive energy |

### Awaiting Test
- 27 predictions await experimental validation

## Key Equations Reference

The framework reduces to five key equations:

**1. Universal Coherence**
```
C(x) = tanh(γ × g(x))
```

**2. γ Formula**
```
γ_eff = (d - n_c) / √N_corr
```

**3. Superconductor Tc**
```
Tc ~ θ_D × (2/γ) × 0.14
```

**4. Gap Ratio**
```
2Δ/(kTc) = 2√π / tanh(γ × ln(2))
```

**5. Kinetic Isotope Effect**
```
KIE ~ 7 × exp(2/γ - 2)
```
