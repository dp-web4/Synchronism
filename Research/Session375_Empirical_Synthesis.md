# Session #375: Empirical Execution IV - Arc Synthesis

**Empirical Execution Arc - Part 4 (Arc Finale)**
**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Status**: 8/8 verified ✓

## Overview

This session synthesizes all findings from the Empirical Execution Arc (Sessions #372-375), the first arc to perform actual empirical tests of Synchronism predictions using real observational data.

## Arc Summary

### Session #372: SPARC Surface Brightness Test
- SB-anomaly correlation confirmed (r = -0.66, p ≈ 0)
- Measured α = -0.157 (not -0.50 as predicted)
- **Discovery**: P7 is mathematically equivalent to the RAR

### Session #373: Acceleration Regime Analysis
- α(g_bar) profile measured continuously
- V-shaped RAR scatter discovered (NP4 support)
- a₀ = c H₀ Ω_m^φ verified at ~10% accuracy
- 5 genuinely novel predictions identified (NP1-NP5)

### Session #374: RAR Environment Dependence (NP2)
- Morphology: F(late/early) = 3.14 (SUPPORTS NP2)
- Surface brightness: F(LSB/HSB) = 1.99 (SUPPORTS NP2)
- Luminosity: r = -0.19, p = 0.01 (SUPPORTS NP2)
- Acceleration-controlled: F = 4.51 (STRONG SUPPORT)
- Gas fraction confound not yet resolved

### Session #375: Arc Synthesis (This Session)
- Prediction catalog revised
- 5 honest failures documented
- Impact assessment: Grade B-
- Next arc recommended: Gas Fraction Control

## What Synchronism Got Right

1. **Direction of SB-anomaly correlation** - negative, as predicted
2. **a₀ derivation** - a₀ = c H₀ Ω_m^φ matches within 10-13%
3. **Environment-dependent scatter** - all three proxy tests consistent
4. **V-shaped scatter profile** - minimum near g†, as coherence model predicts

## What Synchronism Got Wrong

1. **α = -0.5 prediction** - measured α = -0.06 to -0.28 (always shallower)
2. **P7 novelty claim** - it's the RAR, not a new prediction
3. **Gas fraction confound** - not resolved for NP2

## Novel Predictions Status

| ID | Prediction | Tested? | Result |
|----|-----------|---------|--------|
| NP1 | a₀ = c H₀ Ω_m^φ | Yes | SUPPORTED (~10%) |
| NP2 | RAR scatter environment-dependent | Yes | PARTIAL SUPPORT (F = 2-4.5) |
| NP3 | a₀ evolves with redshift | No | Needs high-z data |
| NP4 | Phase transition at g† | Yes | SUGGESTIVE (V-shape) |
| NP5 | Wide binary density dependence | No | Needs Gaia DR3 |

## Key Discovery: Environment-Dependent RAR Scatter

The most important finding: **RAR scatter correlates with galaxy type/mass/SB in the direction predicted by Synchronism**. Late-type, low-mass, low-SB galaxies show 2-4x more scatter than early-type, high-mass, high-SB galaxies. This signal persists when controlling for acceleration regime.

**This is NOT predicted by MOND** (where a₀ is universal). If confirmed after controlling for gas fraction, this would be significant evidence for Synchronism's environment-dependent γ.

## Honest Failures

1. **P7 prediction failure**: α measured far from -0.5
2. **Novelty failure**: P7 not recognized as RAR equivalent
3. **Confound unresolved**: Gas fraction may explain NP2
4. **Small sample**: 175 galaxies insufficient for robust splits
5. **Circular reasoning risk**: φ exponent is fit, not derived

## Impact Assessment: Grade B-

- Direction correct, magnitude wrong for primary prediction
- Genuinely novel NP2 finding (with caveats)
- Honest about failures and limitations
- Real observational data analyzed (not simulated)

## Recommended Next Arcs

| Priority | Arc | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| HIGH | Gas Fraction Control | Re-analyze NP2 controlling for gas fraction |
| HIGH | g† First-Principles | Derive a₀ from γ = 2/√N_corr |
| MEDIUM | Wide Binary Analysis | Test NP5 with Gaia DR3 |
| MEDIUM | Quantum Meta-Analysis | Test P4 with published coherence data |
