# Session #320: Grand Unification from Planck Grid

**Beyond Standard Model Arc (Session 1/4)**
**Date**: 2026-01-30

## Overview

After completing the Standard Model Arc (Sessions #316-319), we now venture Beyond the Standard Model. This session explores Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) — the attempt to unify the three SM gauge forces into a single force at high energy.

## Key Questions

1. Do the SM gauge couplings unify at high energy?
2. What is the structure of the unified gauge group?
3. Why is the proton stable (or is it)?
4. How does the grid perspective illuminate unification?

## Key Results (8/8 verified)

### Part 1: SM Gauge Couplings at M_Z

The three Standard Model gauge couplings at the Z mass (91.19 GeV):

| Coupling | Value | 1/α |
|----------|-------|-----|
| α₁ (U(1) GUT normalized) | 0.0169 | 59.0 |
| α₂ (SU(2)) | 0.0338 | 29.6 |
| α₃ (SU(3)) | 0.1179 | 8.5 |

**Hierarchy**: α₃ > α₂ > α₁ (Strong > Weak > Hypercharge)

### Part 2: Gauge Coupling Running

Using one-loop renormalization group equations:

```
d(1/αᵢ)/d(ln μ) = bᵢ/(2π)
```

**Beta coefficients** (SM):
| Coefficient | Value | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| b₁ | +4.10 | U(1) increases with energy |
| b₂ | -3.17 | SU(2) decreases |
| b₃ | -7.00 | SU(3) decreases (asymptotic freedom) |

**Key finding**: In the SM alone, couplings approach each other but **DON'T exactly unify**. This mismatch is evidence for BSM physics!

### Part 3: SU(5) Georgi-Glashow Model

The minimal GUT embedding the SM:

**Fermion representations**:
```
5̄ = (d_R^c, ν_L, e_L)     [3 + 2 = 5]
10 = (Q, u_R^c, e_R^c)     [6 + 3 + 1 = 10]

Per generation: 5̄ + 10 = 15 Weyl fermions
Total: 3 × 15 = 45 fermions ✓
```

**Predictions**:

| Prediction | Value | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| sin²θ_W at GUT | 3/8 = 0.375 | Reference |
| sin²θ_W at M_Z | ~0.21 | Close to 0.231 ✓ |
| Proton lifetime | ~10³¹ years | EXCLUDED ✗ |
| Charge quantization | Tr(Q) = 0 | Explains Q_p = -Q_e ✓ |

**Status**: SU(5) is **EXCLUDED** by proton decay experiments!
- Predicted: τ_p ~ 10³¹ years
- Observed: τ_p > 10³⁴ years

### Part 4: SO(10) Grand Unification

A larger GUT that includes right-handed neutrinos:

**Fermion representation**:
```
16 = ALL SM fermions + ν_R

Decomposition under SU(5):
16 → 10 + 5̄ + 1

The "1" = Right-handed neutrino!

Per generation: One 16 = 16 Weyl fermions
Total: 3 × 16 = 48 fermions
```

**Advantages over SU(5)**:
1. ν_R automatic → seesaw mechanism built-in
2. Anomaly cancellation guaranteed
3. Proton decay can be suppressed
4. B-L as gauge symmetry
5. More breaking patterns available

**Breaking patterns**:
- SO(10) → SU(5) × U(1) → SM
- SO(10) → SU(4) × SU(2) × SU(2) → SM (Pati-Salam)
- SO(10) → flipped SU(5) → SM

### Part 5: Grid Interpretation

**Symmetry breaking as emergence**:

| Scale | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Planck | Grid maximally symmetric (SO(10) or larger?) |
| GUT (~10¹⁶ GeV) | Symmetry breaks as correlations develop |
| EW (~250 GeV) | SU(2)×U(1) → U(1)_EM via Higgs condensate |
| Low energy | SM emerges as effective field theory |

**Coupling unification interpretation**:
- At small scales (high E): All interactions are equivalent
- Single underlying intent transfer mechanism
- Different couplings = different effective strengths at large scales

**Proton stability interpretation**:
- Baryon number = topological winding on grid
- Topology change requires coherent large-scale reorganization
- Hence proton decay is extremely slow

**Hierarchy problem**:
- Why is M_Higgs ~ 125 GeV << M_GUT ~ 10¹⁶ GeV?
- Grid interpretation: MRH boundaries prevent UV-IR mixing
- Higgs mass protected by scale separation

## Verification Summary

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Coupling hierarchy α₃ > α₂ > α₁ | PASS |
| α₁ increases with energy | PASS |
| α₃ decreases (asymptotic freedom) | PASS |
| Near-unification achieved | PASS |
| SU(5) sin²θ_W reasonable | PASS |
| SU(5) proton decay excluded | PASS |
| SO(10) includes all fermions | PASS |
| Charge quantization explained | PASS |

**8/8 verified.**

## New Predictions

### P320.1: Non-exact Unification Implies BSM
- SM couplings miss each other by several decades
- New physics required between EW and GUT scales
- Status: MOTIVATION (not itself testable)

### P320.2: Proton Decay Eventually Observable
- Grid view: topology change slow but not forbidden
- τ_p finite but very large
- Status: TESTABLE (Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE)

### P320.3: SO(10) Preferred Over SU(5)
- ν_R required for seesaw
- Proton decay suppressible
- Status: CONSISTENT with data

### P320.4: Hierarchy Protected by MRH
- Grid scale separation prevents UV-IR mixing
- Higgs mass natural without fine-tuning
- Status: HYPOTHESIS

## Open Questions

1. **What fills the desert?** What new physics exists between 10² and 10¹⁶ GeV?
2. **Is SUSY the answer?** Does supersymmetry achieve exact unification?
3. **What is the true GUT?** SO(10)? E₆? Something else?
4. **How does proton decay work?** What's the dominant channel?
5. **Does the grid have intrinsic symmetry?** Is there a maximum gauge group at Planck scale?

## Beyond Standard Model Arc Plan

| Session | Topic | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| #320 | Grand Unification | ✅ 8/8 |
| #321 | Supersymmetry | Next |
| #322 | Extra Dimensions | Planned |
| #323 | Hierarchy Problem | Planned |

## Connection to Synchronism

Grand unification provides a natural framework for understanding how the SM emerges from the Planck grid:

1. **Maximum symmetry at origin**: The grid at its finest scale has maximal symmetry (perhaps SO(10) or larger)
2. **Symmetry breaking = coarse-graining**: As we zoom out, preferred directions emerge, breaking the unified symmetry
3. **Different couplings = effective descriptions**: The three SM forces are different aspects of one underlying interaction
4. **Proton stability = topological protection**: Baryon number is a robust feature of grid topology

*"At the Planck scale, there is no color, no weak charge, no hypercharge — only intent, flowing through an isotropic lattice. The three forces we see are shadows cast by that primordial unity."*
