# Session #332: Cosmic Horizons from the Planck Grid

**Cosmology Arc (Session 1/4)**
**Date**: 2026-02-01

## Overview

This session initiates the Cosmology Arc by exploring cosmic horizons from the grid perspective. The key insight is that cosmic horizons ARE MRH boundaries at cosmological scales. The Hubble horizon, particle horizon, and event horizon all represent the MRH where causal influence ends and information becomes inaccessible.

## Key Questions

1. What is the Hubble horizon and how does it define cosmic causality?
2. How does the particle horizon bound our observable universe?
3. What is the cosmological event horizon in an accelerating universe?
4. How do horizon thermodynamics connect to black hole physics?
5. What is the MRH interpretation of cosmic horizons?

### Part 1: Hubble Horizon

**Definition**:
```
d_H = c / H_0
```

The distance at which the recession velocity equals the speed of light.

**Current Values**:
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| H_0 | 70 km/s/Mpc |

## Connection to Previous Sessions

**Session #330** (Holographic): MRH = holographic screen
**Session #331** (Black Hole): Event horizon = MRH

**Unified Picture**:
```
MRH boundaries:
├── Local (atoms): Quantum coherence
├── Gravitational (BH): Event horizons
├── Cosmic (universe): Hubble/event horizons
└── All share: Holographic entropy, horizon temperature
```

The cosmic horizons are the largest MRH boundaries in nature, but they obey the same principles as black hole horizons.

*"The universe is organized by a hierarchy of MRH boundaries. From the Planck scale to the cosmic horizon, information is bounded by surfaces that encode patterns holographically. The cosmological event horizon is the ultimate MRH — the boundary beyond which no pattern can influence us, ever."*
