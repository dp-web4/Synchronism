# Session #333: Inflation from the Planck Grid

**Cosmology Arc (Session 2/4)**
**Date**: 2026-02-01

## Overview

This session explores cosmic inflation from the grid perspective. The key insight is that inflation is exponential grid expansion driven by a slowly-evolving scalar field. The inflaton rolls down a potential, stretching the grid by ~10^26 in ~10^-32 seconds. This solves the horizon, flatness, and monopole problems while seeding structure through quantum fluctuations frozen onto the expanding MRH.

## Key Questions

1. What are the horizon, flatness, and monopole problems?
2. How does inflation solve these problems?
3. What are the slow-roll conditions?
4. How do quantum fluctuations become structure?
5. What is the MRH interpretation of inflation?

### Part 2: Inflationary Solution

**Basic Requirements**:

| Minimum e-foldings | N ≥ 60 |
| Expansion factor | exp(60) ~ 10^26 |
| Start time | ~10^-36 s (GUT scale) |

| Duration | ~10^-32 s |

**Size Evolution**:

| Observable now | ~10^26 m |
| Total expansion | ~10^56 |

**Grid Interpretation**:
| Concept | Grid Meaning |
|---------|--------------|
| Inflation | Exponential grid stretching |
| e-folding | Grid doubles in log(2)/H time |

### Part 3: Slow-Roll Dynamics

**Slow-Roll Parameters**:
```
ε = (M_P²/2) × (V'/V)²    (kinetic/potential)
η = M_P² × (V''/V)        (curvature)
```

**Conditions for Inflation**:
| Condition | Requirement | Physical Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| ε << 1 | V'/V small | Potential nearly flat |
| |η| << 1 | V''/V small | Curvature small |
| ε → 1 | End | Kinetic ~ potential |

**Example: Chaotic Inflation V(φ) = ½m²φ²**:
| φ (M_P) | ε | η | N_remaining |
|---------|---|---|-------------|
| 15 | 0.009 | 0.009 | ~115 |
| 10 | 0.02 | 0.02 | ~50 |
| √2 | 1 | 1 | End |

**Grid Interpretation**:
| Concept | Grid Meaning |
|---------|--------------|
| Inflaton | Scalar pattern controlling grid rate |
| Slow-roll | Gradual pattern descent |
| Potential | Pattern energy landscape |
| End | Pattern reaches steep region |

### Part 4: Quantum Fluctuations → Structure

**Observed CMB Parameters**:
| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| P_s | 2.1 × 10^-9 | Scalar amplitude |
| n_s | 0.965 | Spectral index |
| r | < 0.036 | Tensor-to-scalar bound |

**Model Predictions**:
| Model | n_s | r | Status |
|-------|-----|---|--------|
| m²φ² | 0.967 | 0.133 | RULED OUT |
| φ⁴ | 0.951 | 0.265 | RULED OUT |
| Starobinsky R² | 0.965 | 0.003 | CONSISTENT |
| Natural | 0.97 | 0.05 | Marginal |
| Higgs | 0.966 | 0.003 | CONSISTENT |

**Horizon Crossing**:
- Quantum fluctuations exit horizon during inflation
- Freeze as classical perturbations
- Re-enter after inflation → seed structure
- δρ/ρ ~ √P_s ~ 5 × 10^-5 at horizon crossing

**Grid Interpretation**:
| Concept | Grid Meaning |
|---------|--------------|
| Quantum fluctuations | Planck-scale pattern noise |
| Horizon crossing | Patterns frozen at MRH |
| Classical perturbations | Stretched noise becomes real |
| Structure seeds | Galaxies from quantum patterns |

### Part 5: MRH Interpretation of Inflation

**Timeline with MRH**:
| Phase | MRH Size | Pattern Behavior |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Pre-inflation | Growing | Correlated, quantum |
| During | ~Constant | Patterns exit, freeze |
| End | Starts growing | Reheating begins |
| Radiation era | Growing | Patterns re-enter |
| Matter era | Growing | Structure forms |
| Now | ~14 Gly | We observe frozen seeds |

**Core Insight**:
```
BEFORE INFLATION:
├── Tiny causally connected patch (~ 10^5 L_P)
├── All patterns within single MRH
└── Quantum correlations extend across patch

DURING INFLATION:
├── MRH (Hubble horizon) nearly constant: d_H = c/H
├── Space stretches exponentially: a ∝ exp(Ht)
├── Physical distances grow faster than MRH
└── Patterns EXIT the MRH → freeze as classical

AFTER INFLATION:
├── Huge volume, all from single pre-inflation MRH
├── Uniform because was once causally connected
├── Quantum fluctuations → classical seeds
└── MRH grows again → patterns re-enter
```

## Connection to Previous Sessions

**Session #332** (Cosmic Horizons): Horizons as MRH boundaries
**Session #333** (Inflation): MRH dynamics during inflation

**Unified Picture**:
```
Cosmic MRH Evolution:
├── Pre-inflation: Single MRH contains all patterns
├── Inflation: Patterns exit constant MRH
├── Post-inflation: MRH grows, patterns re-enter
├── Structure: Re-entering patterns → galaxies
└── Now: We see frozen MRH imprints as CMB
```

Inflation is the epoch where MRH dynamics dramatically change — instead of growing with the universe, the MRH is nearly constant while space expands exponentially. This causes quantum patterns to "freeze out" and become the seeds for all cosmic structure.

*"Inflation is the exponential stretching of the Planck grid. Quantum patterns that were once correlated within a single MRH are stretched to cosmic scales. The uniformity of the CMB is not a puzzle — it is the memory of when everything we can see was once inside the same MRH."*
