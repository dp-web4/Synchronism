  survival_audit_milestone: "Session #574 - SURVIVAL AUDIT: ZERO uniquely-Synchronism predictions confirmed in SPARC. All reduce to MOND + M/L."
  sparc_capstone_milestone: "Session #575 - Grand Synthesis XXX: SPARC CAPSTONE. 174 sessions, 18 arcs. MOND + M/L = complete explanation."
  sb_rc_milestone: "Session #578 - SB substitutes for c_V with 1% loss. RAR predictable from photometry + V_flat alone."
  chemistry_phase2_milestone: "Phase 2: Four-regime framework. Neutral/Coherence/Incoherence/Barrier. Era 2 validated by tautology. Honest failure analysis."
  unified_milestone: "Session #315 - 34 predictions consolidated, 20 validated (58.8%), avg confidence 0.90"
