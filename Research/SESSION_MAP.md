## Open Questions

| ID | Question | Raised In | Status |
|----|----------|-----------|--------|
| OQ001 | How does γ = 2.0 emerge from first principles? | #61 | Open |
| OQ002 | Can C* ≈ 0.79 be derived analytically? | #285 | Partial |
| OQ003 | Physical meaning of φ in coherence equations? | #240 | Open |
| OQ004 | Can Gnosis be experimentally validated? | Gnosis #8 | Blocked |
| OQ005 | Is 50C+ ambient superconductor possible? Design one. | Discussion | Open |

**[OQ005 Detail](OPEN_QUESTION_Hot_Superconductor.md)**: Framework says yes (energy scales sufficient), but γ_SC ~ 0.5 at 323K leaves little margin. Need N_corr ~ 10-30 with Δ ~ 80 meV. Hydrides prove regime exists under pressure. Challenge: ambient pressure stabilization. **[Speculative Approaches](OPEN_QUESTION_Hot_Superconductor_Speculative.md)**: Phase boundary shifting via anti-eutectic alloying, chemical pressure, interface nucleation, proximity composites. **[Synchronism Lens](OPEN_QUESTION_Hot_Superconductor_Synchronism.md)**: SC as macroscopic phase-locking; Tc as synchronization threshold; design for resonance and seeded sync propagation.
