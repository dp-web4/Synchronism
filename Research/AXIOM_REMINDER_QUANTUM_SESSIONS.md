# Synchronism Axiom Reminder (for Quantum Sessions)

**Purpose**: Prevent axiom drift in quantum-related research sessions.

---

## Core Axiom

Synchronism is a **single-observer model** and is **premised on fundamental non-locality** at the Observer level.

"Locality" is a **witness-level synchronization artifact** arising from:
- Limited MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)
- Reduced frames / bandwidth constraints
- Incomplete witness synchronization

---

## Interpretation Guide

When session logs contain phrases like:
- "WITHOUT nonlocality"
- "local mechanism for Bell violations"
- "explained without spooky action"

These should be read as:
1. **Without witness-to-witness signaling** (no superluminal communication between witnesses)
2. **Without collapse-story handwaving** (alternative to Copenhagen narrative)

**NOT** as:
- Local hidden-variable evasion of Bell's theorem
- Claim that reality is fundamentally local

---

## Why This Matters

Bell's theorem rules out a specific bundle of assumptions:
- Locality (in the operational sense)
- Realism / counterfactual definiteness
- Measurement independence

Synchronism **does not** attempt to preserve all three. It explicitly embraces non-locality at the Observer level while explaining why witnesses *experience* apparent locality.

## For Future Sessions

When exploring quantum phenomena through Synchronism:

1. **Remember the hierarchy**:
   - Observer: non-local, global state evolution
   - Witnesses: local models within MRH, synchronization artifacts

2. **Be precise about claims**:
   - "No witness-level signaling" ≠ "fundamentally local"
   - "Alternative mechanism" ≠ "Bell evasion"

3. **Avoid mode-mismatch**:
   - Don't accidentally argue for local hidden variables
   - The coherence framework operates at Observer level

---

## The Honest Framing

Synchronism's position on Bell:
- Bell violations are **expected** (reality is non-local at Observer level)
- "Locality" is what witnesses perceive due to sync limitations
- The question isn't "how to make it local" but "why do witnesses experience locality despite non-local reality"

This is a different research question than "evading Bell."
