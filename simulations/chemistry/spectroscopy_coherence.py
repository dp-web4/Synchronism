Chemistry Session #208: Spectroscopy through Coherence Framework

Key findings:
- Oscillator strength: f = 1 is reference (6/16 at γ ~ 1)
- Quantum yield: Φ = 1 is radiative limit (5/12 high Φ)
- Franck-Condon: S ~ 1 characteristic (7/8 at S ~ 1!)
- Selection rules ARE coherence conditions
- FC_00 = exp(-S) at S = 1 gives 1/e = γ ~ 1!
