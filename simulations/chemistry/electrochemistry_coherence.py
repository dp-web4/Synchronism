Chemistry Session #209: Electrochemistry through Coherence Framework

Key findings:
- Transfer coefficient α = 0.5 for 12/14 reactions (symmetric barrier!)
- Nernst: Q = 1 at E = E° (equilibrium, γ ~ 1)
- Exchange current: i_ox = i_red = i₀ at η = 0
- Tafel 118 mV/decade for α = 0.5 (γ ~ 1)
- Butler-Volmer α = 0.5 IS Brønsted α = 0.5 (#206)!
