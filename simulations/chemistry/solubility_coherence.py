Chemistry Session #207: Solubility through Coherence Framework

Key findings:
- Saturation: Q/Ksp = 1 is THE equilibrium (γ ~ 1)
- Partition: log P = 0 means equal partition (5/16 near γ ~ 1)
- Hildebrand: 'Like dissolves like' = δ_solute/δ_solvent ~ 1
- Henry's law: At equilibrium p/(k_H × c) = 1
- Nucleation barrier at γ ~ 1 transition
