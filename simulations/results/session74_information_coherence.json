OBSERVER COUNT MODEL\n   C \u221d log(N_obs) where N_obs \u221d \u03c1\n   \u2192 C \u221d log(\u03c1)\n\n   Physical basis: More matter = more witnesses to reality\n   Quantum Darwinism: Redundant recording stabilizes classical states\n\n   Result: Correlation with tanh(log(\u03c1)) = 0.950\n\n2. QUANTUM DARWINISM\n   Redundancy R \u221d N_env\n   Classicality C = R/(R + R_0)\n\n   Physical basis: Classical objectivity from redundant encoding\n\n   Result: Correlation with tanh(log(\u03c1)) = 0.819\n\n3. ENTROPY-BASED\n   C = 1 - S/S_max\n   Correlations reduce S \u2192 higher C in dense regions\n\n   Physical basis: Correlations increase with density\n\n   Result: Correlation with tanh(log(\u03c1)) = nan\n\nCONCLUSION:\nAll three approaches give coherence increasing with density.\nObserver count model directly gives log(\u03c1) scaling.\nThe tanh saturation comes from finite maximum coherence.\n\nKey insight: tanh(\u03b3 log(\u03c1/\u03c1_c + 1)) combines:\n- Logarithmic information scaling (log term)\n- Bounded output (tanh)\n- Critical density threshold (\u03c1_c)\n- Steepness parameter (\u03b3)\n    ",

    "insight": "\nWHY TANH(LOG)?\n\nThe logarithm log(x) is:\n- Unbounded (\u2192 \u221e as x \u2192 \u221e)\n- Undefined for x < 0\n- Slow growth (slower than any polynomial)\n\nFor coherence, we need:\n- Bounded [0, 1]\n- Defined for all \u03c1 > 0\n- Increasing with \u03c1\n\nApplying tanh to log gives:\n- tanh(log(x)) \u2192 1 as x \u2192 \u221e (bounded)\n- tanh(log(x)) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0 (proper limit)\n- Smooth S-curve in log-space\n\nAlternative: erf(log(x)/2) gives similar shape.\n\nThe CHOICE of tanh over erf or sigmoid is:\n1. Mathematical convenience (derivative is simple)\n2. Symmetric saturation\n3. Matches empirical data best (Session #42: 64.6% success)\n\nDERIVATION STATUS:\n- Log scaling: DERIVED from information theory\n- Tanh bounding: CHOSEN for mathematical convenience\n- \u03b3 = 2: From decoherence analysis (Session #46)\n- \u03c1_crit: Empirical or from virial arguments\n    "
