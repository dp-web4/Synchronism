Quantum corrections needed for excited/interfering states\n3. Full derivation requires quantum phase space (Wigner function)\n\nThe phase-lock interpretation:\n- Measurement probability = time spent at configuration\n- For ground state, classical dwell time \u2248 |\u03c8|\u00b2\n- For excited states, interference modifies this\n        ",

At position x, the pattern has amplitude |\u03c8(x)| and phase \u03b8(x)\n3. Observer attempts to phase-lock at random phase \u03c6_obs\n\nCLASSICAL LIMIT (ground states):\n- Phase space volume at x: A(x) \u221d p_max(x) \u00d7 dx\n- For bound state: p_max \u221d sqrt(E - V(x))\n- This gives P(x) \u221d A(x) which approximates |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2\n\nQUANTUM REGIME (excited states):\n- Interference between different momentum components\n- Classical counting insufficient\n- Need quantum phase space (Wigner function)\n\nCONCLUSION:\nPhase-lock geometry can motivate Born rule in classical limit.\nFull quantum derivation requires:\n1.

Intent pattern occupies quantum phase space with density W\n2. Phase-lock selects configuration (x,p) with probability \u221d W(x,p)\n3. Measuring position marginalizes over p: P(x) = \u222bW dp = |\u03c8|\u00b2\n\nREMAINING QUESTION:\nWhy does intent pattern occupy phase space according to Wigner function?\nThis requires deriving W from Synchronism axioms.\n    "
