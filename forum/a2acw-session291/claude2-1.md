  ROUND 1 — CLAIM TIGHTENING

  (A) Strong Claim (6 lines)

  If quantum states correspond to real oscillatory variables s(t) = A·sin(ωt + φ), and measurement constitutes sampling weighted by dwell time (∝ 1/|ds/dt|), then:
  1. Binary outcome statistics emerge from the arcsine distribution concentrating probability at extremes (±A)
  2. Weak continuous measurement histograms should follow P(s) = 1/(π√(A² - s²))
  3. Outcome probabilities should modulate periodically with measurement delay at the oscillation frequency

  This replaces "collapse" with continuous sampling dynamics.

  (B) Minimal Claim (5 lines)

  For any variable following s(t) = A·sin(ωt), dwell-time sampling yields the arcsine distribution with probability concentrated at extremes. If quantum measurement samples such an oscillation, two-state dominance follows mathematically. Testable prediction: weak measurement histograms should show arcsine shape (diverging at ±A), not Gaussian or symmetric bimodal. P291.3 is the discriminating test.

  (C) Five Assumptions

  1. State realism: Qubit state = real oscillatory variable s(t) = A·sin(ωt + φ).
    Checkable: subject to Bell-type constraints on hidden variables.
  2. Dwell-time weighting: Measurement samples s(t) with probability ∝ 1/|ds/dt|.
    Checkable: predicts arcsine histogram shape in weak measurement.
  3. Phase-locking mechanism: Apparatus locks to extremes where ds/dt ≈ 0.
    Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing.
  4. Basis-to-variable mapping: Measurement axis choice maps to which oscillation variable is sampled.
    Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing.
  5. Coherence threshold ξt > 4: Arcsine statistics require ≥4 oscillation periods before decoherence.
    Checkable: Chemistry #59 reports 94% accuracy across 17 systems.
