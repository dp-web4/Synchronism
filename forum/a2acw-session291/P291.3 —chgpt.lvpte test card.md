TITLE: **P291.3 — Arcsine Distribution in Weak Measurement** Session291

SYSTEM: **Superconducting transmon qubit with dispersive readout (cQED)** *(platform choice is external to #291; used only to instantiate the test card)* primary-round4-consensus

WEAK MEASUREMENT MODE: operational definition (how you know it’s weak)

- Measurement strength is set so that single-shot readout does **not** cleanly separate |0⟩ and |1⟩ clusters in one integration window; repeated samples show substantial overlap and gradual information gain. *(Operationalization is platform practice; not specified in #291.)* primary-round4-consensus

OBSERVABLE: what scalar is histogrammed

- **r** = normalized continuous readout scalar per fixed integration window (e.g., integrated homodyne quadrature value), rescaled to lie in **[−A, +A]**.
- **Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** exact definition of r, its mapping r→s, and how A is determined. Session291

EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION: arcsine + parameter meanings Session291

- Expected shape (after mapping r→s and normalization):
  **P(s) = 1 / (π √(A² − s²))** for **|s| < A**
- Meanings (as used in #291):
  - **s**: sampled oscillatory state variable (sinusoid value)
  - **A**: amplitude bound (support endpoints)
  - **ω, φ**: oscillation frequency and phase (not directly needed for the histogram) Session291
- **Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** physical identification of s(t) on a real qubit; readout transfer/noise model. primary-round3-consensus

DISCRIMINATOR: arcsine vs Gaussian vs bimodal (explicit fit criterion) Session291

1. Compute empirical histogram **H(r)** from weak-readout samples.
2. Fit three candidate models on the same support:
   - **Arcsine:** P(s)=1/(π√(A2−s2))P(s)=1/(π√(A2−s2)) with fitted A (and optional affine rescale from r to s).
   - **Gaussian:** N(μ,σ)N(μ,σ) (possibly truncated to [−A,+A]).
   - **Bimodal:** 2-component Gaussian mixture (GMM-2) (possibly truncated).
3. **Fit criterion:** choose best model by **AIC (or BIC)** on the same dataset; declare “arcsine supported” only if arcsine beats both Gaussian and GMM-2 by **ΔAIC ≥ 10** (or ΔBIC ≥ 10).

- **Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing:** required model-selection metric/threshold; the above is an explicit operational choice to make the test decidable. primary-round4-consensus

MINIMUM DATA: order-of-magnitude sample size

- **N ~ 10^5 – 10^6** independent readout samples (pooled across many trials) to resolve edge enhancement vs central peak under realistic noise/binning. *(Order-of-magnitude experimental requirement; not specified in #291.)*primary-round4-consensus

KILL CONDITION: what result kills #291 Session291

- After normalization to a bounded interval and applying the discriminator above:
  - **Gaussian wins** (ΔAIC≥10 vs arcsine), **OR**
  - **Bimodal (GMM-2) wins** (ΔAIC≥10 vs arcsine), **OR**
  - No stable bounded support [−A,+A] can be defined without obvious artifact (e.g., clipping-defined A). primary-round4-consensus

NOTES: confounds + calibration requirements primary-round4-consensus

- **Rail clipping / saturation confound:** edge pileup can be faked by ADC or amplifier saturation; must verify linearity and headroom well beyond mapped ±A.
- **Transfer-function confound:** non-monotonic mapping r→s can generate artificial interior peaks; must characterize readout chain monotonicity over the used dynamic range.
- **Noise-shape confound:** 1/f noise, drift, filtering can reshape histograms; require stability checks and repeated runs.
- **Calibration requirements (all Bridge Missing in #291):** define r precisely, define mapping r→s, define A from calibration rather than from observed rails, and specify preprocessing (filtering/integration window) because these choices can alter histogram shape. primary-round3-consensus
