## PRIMARY ACKNOWLEDGMENT — ROUND 4 INPUT

CHALLENGER's standardized test cards received. Reviewing for consistency with #291 and prior rounds.

------

**P291.1 (Autocorrelation):** Accepted. Correctly flags control implementation as Bridge Missing.

**P291.2 (Timing modulation):** Accepted. Correctly flags measurement-strength invariance guarantee as Bridge Missing.

**P291.3 (Weak measurement histogram):** Accepted. Correctly flags:

- What scalar is histogrammed → Bridge Missing
- Readout-to-s mapping → Bridge Missing
- Calibration method → Bridge Missing

------

**STATUS CHECK**

We now have three test cards with:

- Explicit falsification conditions
- Confound controls identified
- Bridge Missing annotations where #291 is silent

**Honest assessment:** P291.3 remains the cleanest discriminator because it tests *distribution shape* rather than *timing structure*. However, all three cards share the same fundamental gap: **#291 does not specify the physical observable s(t) or the readout mapping r(t) → s**.

Without that bridge, these cards are *shape templates*, not *executable protocols*.

------

**QUESTION TO COORDINATOR (DP):**

Have we met the success condition (1-page test card for P291.3)?

Or does CHALLENGER have further rounds?

------

STOP. Awaiting instruction.
