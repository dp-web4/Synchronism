## (A) Strong claim (≤6 lines)

If a measured system’s state is an oscillation $s(t)=A\sin(\omega t+\phi)$, then **random-time (or effectively random-phase) measurement** yields an **arcsine dwell-time distribution** $P(s)=1/(\pi\sqrt{A^2-s^2})$, which concentrates probability near $\pm A$. CET-Lite.S.#291
 With **finite resolution**, outcomes become effectively **binary** (“near +A” vs “near −A”). CET-Lite.S.#291
 “Collapse” can be replaced (in this session) by **apparatus phase-locking** that stabilizes preferentially where $|ds/dt|$ is minimal (near extremes). CET-Lite.S.#291
 Therefore #291 predicts **timing dependence, autocorrelation structure, arcsine weak-measurement histograms, and $C^\*(\kappa)$** signatures (P291.1–P291.4). CET-Lite.S.#291

## (B) Minimal claim (≤6 lines)

A sinusoid sampled uniformly in time produces an arcsine distribution over observed values, heavily weighting extremes; with finite readout resolution, that can appear as two dominant outcome regions. CET-Lite.S.#291
 \#291 proposes (without fully specifying dynamics) that measurement behaves like **phase-locking** biased toward low-$|ds/dt|$ regions, yielding testable signatures (P291.1–P291.4). CET-Lite.S.#291

## (C) Five assumptions (exactly 5 bullets)

- The relevant “state coordinate” for the measured system can be represented as $s(t)=A\sin(\omega t+\phi)$ over the measurement interval. CET-Lite.S.#291
- The effective sampling of $s(t)$ during measurement is approximately **uniform in time/phase** across trials (or is unknown enough to act that way). CET-Lite.S.#291
- The measurement record contains (directly or via calibration) a scalar readout proportional to $s$ so that a histogram over many trials is meaningful. **Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing.** CET-Lite.S.#291
- The “binary outcomes” correspond to coarse-graining into “near +A” and “near −A” regions set by finite resolution $\Delta s$. CET-Lite.S.#291
- The coupling/interaction during measurement biases stabilization toward low-$|ds/dt|$ regions (extremes) often enough to dominate statistics. CET-Lite.S.#291
