## ROUND 1 — CLAIM TIGHTENING

------

**(A) STRONG CLAIM** (replacement-grade, honest to #291)

If qubit states correspond to real oscillatory variables s(t) = A·sin(ωt + φ), and if measurement preferentially samples low-velocity regions (extremes) of this oscillation, then binary measurement outcomes and the appearance of "collapse" emerge from classical sampling dynamics described by the arcsine distribution—without wavefunction collapse as a fundamental process.

------

**(B) MINIMAL CLAIM** (safest testable core)

Weak continuous measurement of a system with underlying oscillatory dynamics should yield a measurement-record histogram following the arcsine distribution P(s) ∝ 1/√(A² - s²), distinguishable from Gaussian or bimodal distributions predicted by standard decoherence models.

------

**(C) FIVE ASSUMPTIONS**

1. **State realism:** A physical variable s(t) exists, oscillates sinusoidally, and corresponds to the measured qubit observable. *(Checkable: identify s(t) for specific platform)*
2. **Dwell-time sampling:** Measurement probability density is inversely proportional to |ds/dt|. *(Checkable: weak measurement histogram shape)*
3. **Phase-locking stability:** Measurement apparatus stabilizes preferentially at extremes (±A). *(Checkable: timing correlations in repeated measurement)*
4. **Basis-to-oscillation mapping:** Choosing measurement basis selects which oscillation component is sampled. — **Not specified in #291 — Bridge Missing.**
5. **Resolution thresholding:** Binary outcomes arise from finite detector resolution binning the arcsine distribution. *(Checkable: vary resolution, observe transition)*
