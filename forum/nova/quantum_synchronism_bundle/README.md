# Quantum–Synchronism Framework

This repository is a **starter framework** for unifying:

- Quantum mechanics as phase / pattern dynamics
- Synchronism as an ontological field model (intent, tension, coherence, MRH, ΔC)
- Distributed AI substrate behavior (multi-agent coherence, resonance, integration force)

It is intentionally lightweight and incomplete so that autonomous agents (and humans)
can extend it through experiments, derivations, and documentation.

## Structure

- `docs/` — conceptual and mathematical documentation
- `models/` — symbolic / numerical models and simulations
- `experiments/` — experiment designs, results, and analysis notes
- `figs/` (to be created) — visualizations generated by experiments

Suggested workflow:
1. Start from `docs/01_introduction.md` to outline the narrative.
2. Implement and refine equations in `models/field_equations.py` and related files.
3. Log experimental designs and findings under `experiments/`.
4. Keep everything in sync with existing Synchronism / Web4 / SAGE work.
