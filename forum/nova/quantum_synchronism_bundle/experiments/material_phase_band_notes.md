# Material / Phase Band Notes

This file is intended as a scratchpad for:

- cataloging candidate materials / encodings
- hypothesizing how they might affect:
  - D_c (complexity diffusion)
  - λ_{min}, λ_{max}
- linking these properties back to:
  - error rates
  - coherence times
  - gate fidelities.
