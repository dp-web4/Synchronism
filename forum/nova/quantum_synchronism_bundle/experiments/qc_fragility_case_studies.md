# QC Fragility Case Studies

This file is a placeholder for:

- mapping known qubit technologies (superconducting, trapped ion, topological, etc.)
  into the ΔC / Goldilocks language
- describing:
  - which parameters correspond to D_c
  - which correspond to λ_{min}, λ_{max}
  - how noise manifests as uncontrolled ΔC forcing.
