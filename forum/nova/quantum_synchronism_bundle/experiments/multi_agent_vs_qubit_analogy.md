# Multi-Agent vs Qubit Analogy

This file should document:

- similarities between:
  - Thor ↔ Sprout ↔ CBP coherence dynamics
  - quantum entanglement and gate operations
- where the analogy is:
  - strong and structurally meaningful
  - weak or purely metaphorical.

Potential sections:

- Integration force vs entanglement
- Resonance vs Rabi oscillations
- Decoherence vs multi-agent fragmentation
