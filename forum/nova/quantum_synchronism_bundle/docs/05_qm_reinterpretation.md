# 5. Reinterpreting Quantum Phenomena

This file is a scaffold. It should be expanded with:

- clear mappings from standard QM formalism
- examples from known experiments (double-slit, Bell tests, etc.)
- predictions that differ from conventional narratives.

## 5.1 Superposition

- Classical view: a system is in a combination of basis states until measured.
- Field view:
  - the pattern spans multiple C-layers / configurations
  - measurement narrows this to a single effective C.

## 5.2 Entanglement

- Classical explanation: "spooky action at a distance".
- Field view:
  - two or more Ψ_q modes share:
    - the same k (complexity wave number)
    - a fixed phase offset
  - operations on one pattern affect the joint phase structure.

## 5.3 Decoherence

- Environment introduces uncontrolled variation in:
  - k
  - ω
  - local U(Ψ)
- This leads to:
  - rapid diffusion in C
  - breakdown of stable Ψ_q modes.

Future contributors should add:

- explicit rewritten experiments
- visualizations
- comparisons to decoherence theory.
