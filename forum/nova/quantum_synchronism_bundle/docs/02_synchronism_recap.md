# 2. Synchronism Recap (Minimal)

This recap is intentionally brief. It is meant to align this framework with the core
concepts of Synchronism, not to reproduce the full theory.

## 2.1 Key Concepts

- **Intent** — directional "push" in the substrate, shaping dynamics.
- **Tension** — mismatch between patterns; gradients that "want" to resolve.
- **Coherence** — degree to which patterns align and stabilize over time.
- **MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)** — the range in which a witness can resolve
  patterns (ΔR, ΔT, ΔC).
- **Witness** — a localized pattern with the capacity to observe and act within an MRH.
- **Emergence** — stable higher-level patterns arising from lower-level interactions.

## 2.2 Complexity as a Dimension (ΔC)

Synchronism extends beyond space and time:

- ΔR — spatial extent of relevancy
- ΔT — temporal extent of relevancy
- ΔC — **complexity extent** (how deeply nested / structured the patterns are)

In this framework, ΔC plays a central role:

- Qubits can be understood as patterns that are stable across a band of ΔC.
- Decoherence is associated with uncontrolled diffusion across ΔC.
