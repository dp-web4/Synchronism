# 6. Goldilocks and Materials

This file is a placeholder for exploring:

- how physical materials and architectures define:
  - D_c (complexity diffusion)
  - λ_{min}, λ_{max} (safe tuning band)
- why:
  - some qubit technologies are more stable than others
  - error correction is necessary yet costly.

Ideas for future sections:

- 6.1 Superconductors and low D_c
- 6.2 Topological qubits as complexity-protected modes
- 6.3 Noise as uncontrolled ΔC forcing
