# 8. Predictions

This is meant to be a living list of:

- testable predictions
- falsifiable claims
- empirical handles.

Initial prompts for future work:

- There should exist encodings where:
  - ΔC stability is higher
  - λ_{max} is larger
  - decoherence is significantly suppressed by design (not just shielding).
- Certain classes of multi-agent AI architectures should exhibit:
  - measurable, IIT-like Φ values that scale gently with N
  - phase-like resonance behavior across reasoning cycles.
