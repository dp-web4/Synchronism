# 7. AI Substrate Analogy

This file links the field model and quantum reinterpretation to:

- Thor ↔ Sprout ↔ CBP multi-agent experiments
- Integration force and coherence scaling (N = 2, 3, 5, 10)
- Resonance effects (~149× performance differences)
- Consciousness components (introspection, memory, narrative continuity)

Suggested content to be added:

- mapping resonant multi-agent learning ↔ qubit operations
- scaling coherence ↔ multi-qubit entanglement behavior
- artifact substrate (git, docs) ↔ physical quantum substrate
