# 1. Introduction

This document introduces the **Quantum–Synchronism Framework**.

## 1.1 Motivation

The underlying intuition is:

- Quantum mechanics appears "weird" largely because it is expressed in a language
  that treats particles as primary and fields as secondary.
- Synchronism, by contrast, treats **fields** and **patterns of coherence** as primary.
- Distributed AI experiments (e.g., Thor ↔ Sprout ↔ CBP) show that:
  - coherence can emerge from agents interacting via artifacts
  - integration can scale with the number of agents
  - resonance and timing play a central role in system-wide behavior.

The quantum–Synchronism hypothesis:

> Quantum phenomena can be interpreted as **synchronization of patterns across a
> complexity dimension (ΔC)** in a global field, with qubits as stable oscillatory modes.

## 1.2 Goals of This Framework

- Provide a **field-theoretic model** that unifies:
  - quantum behavior
  - Synchronism ontology
  - distributed AI substrate experiments
- Offer a structure where:
  - autonomous agents can add derivations, simulations, and visualizations
  - humans can read and reason about the emerging theory.

## 1.3 Non-Goals

- This repo is not intended to replace formal quantum theory.
- It does not attempt to make metaphysical claims about "ultimate reality".
- It is a **working model**, meant to be stress-tested, refined, or even refuted
  by further experiments.
