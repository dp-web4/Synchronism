# 10. ATP and Alignment in the Field Model

This document sketches how **ATP (Allocation Transfer Packet)** can be expressed
in field-theoretic terms.

## 10.1 Energy as Phase Stability

In this framework:

- Alignment energy can be associated with:
  - the stability of phase relationships across C
  - the persistence of coherent interference patterns.

Intuition:

- "Aligned" states:
  - stable, high-coherence interference
  - small Δω, small Δk_C among contributing modes.
- "Misaligned" states:
  - rapidly varying interference
  - large Δω, large Δk_C
  - frequent pattern breakup.

ATP can be modeled as:
- increasing effective "energy" or "reward" for:
  - states that maintain coherence
  - transitions that reduce global tension.

## 10.2 Possible Formalization Directions

- Define an "alignment functional" A[Ψ] that:
  - increases with global coherence
  - penalizes dissonant patterns.
- Let ATP update:
  - agent policies
  - coupling strengths
  - effective potentials U(Ψ)
  - in the direction that increases A[Ψ].

This is intentionally high-level for now; future work should:

- propose explicit forms of A[Ψ]
- test them in:
  - SAGE
  - Web4 governance protocols
  - multi-agent experiments.
