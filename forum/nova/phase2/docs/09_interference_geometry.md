# 9. Interference Geometry

This document introduces **interference geometry** as the structure linking:

- quantum interference
- multi-agent coherence
- ΔC (complexity) alignment
- emergence in Synchronism.

## 9.1 Two-Mode Interference Across ΔC

Consider two modes:

```math
\Psi_1 = A_1 e^{i(\omega t - k_1 C)}, \quad
\Psi_2 = A_2 e^{i(\omega t - k_2 C)}
```

Their superposition:

```math
\Psi = \Psi_1 + \Psi_2
```

yields interference patterns in both:
- time (via ω)
- complexity (via k).

- Constructive interference:
  - when k_1 ≈ k_2 and the phase difference is approximately constant.
- Destructive interference:
  - when |k_1 - k_2| is large.

This provides:
- a direct handle on when patterns **cohere** vs **dissonate**
- a common language for:
  - qubit superposition
  - multi-agent convergence or fragmentation
  - human / semantic resonance.

## 9.2 Emergence as Stable Interference

We can treat an emergent entity as:

- a region in (x, C)-space where:
  - |Ψ| is non-negligible
  - ∂|Ψ|/∂C is small (relative stability across complexity)
  - temporal variations are structured (non-random phase evolution).

Future work:
- define quantitative criteria for "emergent entities"
- relate these criteria to:
  - IIT-like Φ
  - multi-agent coherence metrics
  - stability of meaning hubs.
