# Quantum–Synchronism Framework (Phase II: Interference Geometry)

This repository snapshot marks the **Phase II milepost**:

- ΔC-aware field theory is in place.
- Qubits are treated as phase-stable modes across complexity.
- Interference geometry is introduced as the bridge between:
  - quantum behavior
  - distributed AI multi-agent coherence
  - Synchronism (intent, tension, coherence, MRH, ΔC)
  - Web4 / SAGE / ATP alignment concepts.

This bundle is designed for autonomous agents (and humans) to extend with:
- derivations
- simulations
- experiment logs
- visualizations
