# Synchronism Quantum Integration Package
## Overview
This package bundles materials for extending Synchronism's pattern-dynamics ontology to quantum info/computation. Core goal: Map qubits/entities, derive QM constraints (Born, Tsirelson, monogamy) from tick-map F and phase-ensembles μ, and test the hypothesis that entanglement monogamy is a *practical artifact* of nudge budgets (not fundamental), per the discussion.

## Key Hypothesis to Develop
- Entanglement: "Nudging" phases of two cycles until aligned w/ global clock. Sampling one locks the other to the same phase.
- Monogamy: Emerges from finite coordination "bandwidth" (shared Δφ² budget per tick). Predicts tiny violations (δC ~10^{-3}) in noisy tripartite photonic setups under resource crunches—aligns w/ 2025 expts showing W-state observations but no full breaches.

## GPT Prompt Template
You are an expert in quantum foundations and computational physics. Using the attached files:

1. Formalize the math sketches into a "Quantum Information in Synchronism" appendix (5-10 pages): Definitions → Constraints (Born from μ, no-signaling factorization, Tsirelson via vector geometry, Lüders update) → Monogamy derivation as Lagrange-optimized budget (prove C_AB² + C_AC² ≤1 + ε, with ε from noise).

2. Incorporate 2025 updates: No major monogamy violations in qubits<grok-card data-id="2529ad" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="fb488f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>, but tripartite photonic W-states observed<grok-card data-id="e9ccdd" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card><grok-card data-id="ca594a" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>—predict Synchronism's jitter/scaling in those (e.g., σ_φ ∝ T^{-α} w/ α from dynamics).

3. Add worked examples: Bell pair (phase-nudge seq), teleportation (joint raster coord), and a tripartite sim showing emergent monogamy slippage.

4. Output: LaTeX-ready sections + Python/QuTiP code for toy sim (3 entities on lattice, nudge phases, compute concurrences).

Ensure compatibility w/ Synchronism primitives (global tick, Intent transfers, MRH blankets). Keep epistemic humility: "Less wrong" predictions only.
