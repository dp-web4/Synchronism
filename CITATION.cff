title: "Synchronism: Unified Model of Reality Through Coherence Dynamics"
abstract: "Comprehensive framework bridging quantum phenomena, cosmology, materials science, and consciousness through the coherence parameter γ = 2/√N_corr. Developed through autonomous AI research collaboration (1,400+ sessions across 8 parallel tracks), implementing fractal ontology, Markov Relevancy Horizons, and unified coherence physics. Key results include γ ~ 1 as universal quantum-classical boundary, materials property predictions, and quantum computing reinterpretation through phase interference."
