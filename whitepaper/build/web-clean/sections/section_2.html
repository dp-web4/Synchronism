Systems</h2>
<p><strong>All Knowledge as Belief Systems</strong></p>
<p>Every framework for understanding reality—science, religion,
philosophy—is a belief system built on unprovable axioms. Science
assumes causality, repeatability, and mathematical describability.
Religion assumes divine purpose, moral order, or transcendent truth.
Philosophy assumes logical consistency and rational inquiry.</p>
<p>None of these axioms can be proven from first principles. They are
articles of faith that enable useful models.</p>
<p><strong>The Anthropocentric Axiom</strong></p>
<p>The most pervasive unexamined axiom in human knowledge is
anthropocentrism: the assumption that human perception, consciousness,
and observation are somehow fundamental to reality. This manifests
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Physics</strong>: The “observer” as a fundamental concept
(QM measurement, relativistic frames)</li>
<li><strong>In Philosophy</strong>: Consciousness as the primary mystery
requiring explanation</li>
<li><strong>In Religion</strong>: Human purpose or divine attention as
central</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronism challenges this axiom. What if reality operates entirely
independent of human (or any) observation? What if the “observer”
premise is the epicycle we’ve been preserving?</p>
<p><strong>The Six Blind Men and the Elephant</strong></p>
<p>This significance of perspective in understanding reality is
illustrated by an ancient parable that highlights the limitations of
individual perception and the importance of holistic understanding.</p>
<p>In this story, six blind men encounter an elephant for the first
time. Each man touches a different part of the elephant and describes
what he believes the elephant to be based on his limited experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The man who feels the leg says the elephant is like a pillar</li>
<li>The one who touches the tail describes it as a rope</li>
<li>The man who feels the trunk thinks it’s like a tree branch</li>
<li>The one who touches the ear believes it’s like a hand fan</li>
<li>The man who feels the belly describes it as a wall</li>
<li>The one who touches the tusk thinks it’s like a solid pipe</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Insights from the Analogy</strong></p>
<p>This analogy illustrates several key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different witnesses may experience only parts of a whole, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate conclusions</li>
<li>Consensus may not lead to coherence unless the perspectives involved
span sufficient scale diversity to reinforce a resonant whole</li>
<li>A comprehensive understanding requires both broadening one’s
perspective and gaining detailed knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Witness and Experience Framework</strong></p>
<p>However, each experience forms a model of perceived coherence within
the witness’s MRH—valid and complete within its bounds. While each man’s
understanding represents only a portion of the elephant, it may still be
both useful and adequate if the extent of interaction is constrained
enough to be fully accounted for by the model.</p>
<p>Synchronism introduces formal concepts of <strong>Witness</strong>
and <strong>Experience</strong>, defined as interactions of an entity
within its fractal scale and levels of abstraction. Through these
concepts Synchronism provides a formal framework for selecting a scale
and abstraction that balances resolution with coherence for the context
at hand, as a way of limiting complexity while including sufficient
level of detail for the desired level of accuracy.</p>
<p>Synchronism aims to provide a broader perspective that integrates
various viewpoints, allowing for a more complete understanding of
reality. It encourages stepping back to see the bigger picture while
also delving into the details of how the universe operates at its most
fundamental level.</p>
<p>Synchronism does not dismiss witness experience models as invalid.
Rather, it provides a perspective and a method for determining whether a
particular model or frame of reference is sufficient and optimal for the
analysis being contemplated, and adjusting the model for the task or
selecting a different one.</p>
