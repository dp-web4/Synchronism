<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Synchronism is a framing model of reality that seeks coherence across
belief systems, working to integrate and recontextualize existing
religious, scientific, and philosophical traditions. While comprehensive
in scope, it remains an evolving framework rather than a claim of
completeness, offering a meta-perspective for understanding the universe
and its phenomena.</p>
<p>Developed through a series of philosophical inquiries and thought
experiments, Synchronism attempts to bridge the gap between scientific
understanding and spiritual or metaphysical concepts.</p>
<p>In the Synchronism model, the key concept is “Intent,” which serves
as a reification of the abstract “greater force” proposed by various
belief systems. Intent here is not anthropomorphic—not personal will or
desire—but rather the fundamental quantized measure underlying all
interaction, the precursor to all observable effects including energy,
matter, and consciousness. This reification allows for the
quantification and analysis of the underlying dynamics of reality,
providing a framework that bridges scientific, philosophical, and
spiritual perspectives.</p>
<p>The model proposes a fundamental structure for the universe based on
discrete units of space and time, with a unique concept of “intent” as
the driving force behind all interactions and emergent phenomena. By
offering a new lens through which to view reality, Synchronism
challenges conventional thinking and invites a reevaluation of our
understanding of existence, consciousness, and the nature of the
universe itself.</p>
<p><strong>Single Observer Model</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism is inherently a single-observer model, meaning that all
phenomena are interpreted from the standpoint of a singular, unified
observer. This “observer” is not a person or entity, but rather the
unified consciousness experiencing reality through multiple synchronized
perspectives—the single awareness witnessing all intent patterns cycling
through the universe grid.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Distinction - Witness vs Sovereign
Observer:</strong> What relativistic models call a “sovereign observer”
(an independent, external viewpoint), Synchronism calls a “witness.” The
key difference is that a witness is itself an intent pattern interacting
with other patterns and is an integral part of the witnessing—not
separate from it. The witness participates in and is modified by the act
of witnessing, creating a fundamentally participatory rather than
detached relationship with reality.</p>
<p>This perspective simplifies the complexities associated with multiple
reference frames and provides a coherent narrative of intent transfer
and emergence, while acknowledging that all witnessing is inherently
participatory.</p>
<p>By assuming a single, uniform progression of time across the
universe, Synchronism aligns perception experienced at varying fractal
scales with the underlying mechanics of reality, focusing on how intent
flows and interacts within this unified framework.</p>
<p>This approach contrasts with relativistic models, which allow for
multiple “observers” with potentially conflicting perceptions of time
and space. In Synchronism, time and space are absolute within the single
observer’s framework, providing a consistent reference for understanding
the universe’s evolution. This singular viewpoint is crucial for
maintaining coherence within the model and ensuring that emergent
phenomena are uniformly interpretable. (Note: This divergence from
relativity is a modeling choice within Synchronism’s MRH, not a
rejection of relativistic effects at appropriate scales.)</p>
<p><strong>Limitations and Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>The limitations of individual perspectives, as highlighted in the
parable of the blind men and the elephant, underscore the need for a
comprehensive model like Synchronism that strives for a holistic
understanding of reality. However, Synchronism acknowledges the
practical usefulness of limited-perspective analysis.</p>
<p>This is addressed with concepts like <a href="#mrh">Markov Relevancy
Horizon</a>, <a href="#abstraction">Abstraction</a>, <a
href="#witness-effect">Witness</a> and Experience as part of the
Synchronism model. These tools are not replacements for traditional
scientific methods but extensions that accommodate multi-scale coherence
and fractal analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Formalism</strong></p>
<p>For Synchronism to be a useful and relevant model, it is necessary to
introduce formal mathematical treatments for its key concepts. The
mathematical approach combines discrete dynamics (for grid-based intent
transfer), differential equations (for field effects), and information
theory (for coherence measures). In order to keep the core document as
concise as possible, the complete mathematical formalism is introduced
separately in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>
