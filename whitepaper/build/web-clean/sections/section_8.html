<h2 id="glossary-of-terms">8. Glossary of Terms</h2>
<p>This glossary provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout
the Synchronism framework. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy
reference.</p>
<p><strong>Abstraction</strong></p>
<p>The process through which patterns at one scale give rise to
simplified, higher-level patterns. Enables complexity management through
MRH-appropriate simplification.</p>
<p><strong>Cell</strong></p>
<p>A single point in the universe grid where intent can be deposited.
The fundamental discrete unit of space in Synchronism.</p>
<p><strong>Coherence</strong></p>
<p>The degree of pattern stability and harmony within a system. High
coherence enables stable emergence and pattern persistence. Ethics is
fundamentally a metric of coherence at each scale.</p>
<p><strong>CRT Analogy</strong></p>
<p>The cathode ray tube comparison showing how different sampling rates
(synchronization) create different perceptions of the same underlying
process. Central to understanding quantum phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Cycling</strong></p>
<p>The continuous process by which patterns repeat their sequences.
Patterns never exist in static states - they are always cycling through
their intent distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Decoherence</strong></p>
<p>Loss of pattern synchronization, leading to classical behavior. At
macro scales, overwhelm from numerous patterns prevents quantum
coherence.</p>
<p><strong>Emergence</strong></p>
<p>The phenomenon where collective pattern interactions create new,
higher-level patterns with properties not present in individual
components.</p>
<p><strong>Entanglement (Raster Entanglement)</strong></p>
<p>In Synchronism, “entangled” particles are simply patterns that share
synchronized cycling. Like two CRT screens showing identical images
because they follow the same timing.</p>
<p><strong>Field Effects</strong></p>
<p>The influence patterns have on their local grid neighborhoods.
Creates apparent forces and fields through statistical intent
distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Grid</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental discrete substrate of reality - a three-dimensional
lattice of cells where intent patterns cycle. Space itself in
Synchronism.</p>
<p><strong>Intent</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental “substance” of reality that cycles through grid
cells. Not consciousness or will, but the basic unit of existence that
creates all patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Intent Transfer</strong></p>
<p>The programmed movement of intent between adjacent cells from one
time slice to the next. The mechanism underlying all motion and
change.</p>
<p><strong>Markov Blanket</strong></p>
<p>The boundary between what is immediately relevant to a pattern and
what can be statistically approximated. Defines the pattern’s direct
interaction sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)</strong></p>
<p>The scale at which analysis is most appropriate for a given system.
Beyond this horizon, details can be abstracted without losing essential
behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern</strong></p>
<p>A stable cycling configuration of intent across grid cells.
Everything that exists - particles, waves, objects, thoughts - is a
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Planck Slice</strong></p>
<p>One discrete tick of universal time. The cosmos processes one
complete update of all intent transfers in each Planck-scale time
unit.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Skip</strong></p>
<p>The apparent discontinuous behavior in quantum mechanics, explained
in Synchronism as the grid’s discrete nature showing through at small
scales.</p>
<p><strong>Raster</strong></p>
<p>The scanning pattern of a CRT, used as analogy for how consciousness
samples reality. Different raster rates (synchronization) create
different observed phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Saturation</strong></p>
<p>The maximum intent a cell can hold. Excess intent must transfer to
adjacent cells, creating pressure effects and apparent forces.</p>
<p><strong>Single Observer</strong></p>
<p>The foundational concept that all consciousness is one consciousness
experiencing reality through multiple synchronized perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Sloshing</strong></p>
<p>Colloquial term for intent movement between cells. Captures the
fluid-like dynamics of intent transfer through the grid.</p>
<p><strong>Spectral Existence</strong></p>
<p>The concept that entities exist across a spectrum of pattern
complexity, from simple (particles) to complex (conscious beings).</p>
<p><strong>Superposition</strong></p>
<p>Not a quantum state but the continuous cycling of patterns through
their sequences. What appears as superposition is actually mid-cycle
observation.</p>
<p><strong>Synchronism</strong></p>
<p>The complete framework describing reality as cycling intent patterns
witnessed through synchronization. Also the name of this groundbreaking
model.</p>
<p><strong>Synchronization</strong></p>
<p>The act of consciousness aligning with specific pattern cycles to
witness them. How observation occurs without affecting the patterns
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Tension Field</strong></p>
<p>The gradient of intent density across space. Creates effects like
electromagnetic fields through differential intent distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Time Slice</strong></p>
<p>One discrete moment in the universal timeline. Reality updates in
Planck-scale increments, processing all intent transfers
simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Universe Grid</strong></p>
<p>The complete three-dimensional lattice of cells that constitutes all
of space. The fundamental substrate where all patterns cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Wave Function</strong></p>
<p>In Synchronism, not a probability distribution but a description of
pattern cycling. No collapse occurs - only synchronization timing
changes.</p>
<p><strong>Witnessing</strong></p>
<p>The act of consciousness synchronizing with and experiencing pattern
cycles. Passive observation that doesn’t alter the patterns
themselves.</p>
