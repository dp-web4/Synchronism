<h2 id="synchronism-a-non-anthropocentric-model-of-reality">Synchronism:
A Non-Anthropocentric Model of Reality</h2>
<p><strong>All Models Are Wrong</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism is a computational model of reality built on pattern
dynamics rather than observer-dependent measurements. Like all models,
it is wrong. The question is whether it is “less wrong” than
anthropocentric frameworks for understanding phenomena that current
physics treats as mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>The Core Premise</strong></p>
<p>Anthropocentric science places the observer at the center—measurement
“collapses” quantum states, simultaneity is observer-dependent,
consciousness is privileged. This is the geocentric view: reality
revolving around human perception.</p>
<p>Synchronism proposes the heliocentric alternative: patterns cycle
independently of observation. What we call “observation” is just
synchronization timing with ongoing processes. No mysteries—just
different synchronization rates revealing different aspects of
unchanging pattern dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Intent as Reification</strong></p>
<p>The key concept is <strong>Intent</strong>—a computational
abstraction (reification) that makes an underlying “greater force”
tractable for modeling. Intent is NOT: - A fundamental force -
Ontologically real - A claim about what reality “is”</p>
<p>Intent IS: - A variable we can quantify - A framework enabling
predictions - A useful fiction for computation</p>
<p>Like π in mathematics or variables in programming—abstractions that
make complex systems modelable without claiming to describe ultimate
reality.</p>
<p><strong>What Synchronism Models</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Dynamics:</strong> - Universal grid at Planck scale
(computational substrate) - Time as discrete slices (Planck time
intervals) - Intent transfer between grid cells (the computable
abstraction) - Entities as repeating Intent patterns (whirlpools in a
river) - Interactions: Resonant, Dissonant, Indifferent</p>
<p><strong>Emergent Phenomena:</strong> - Quantum superposition (pattern
cycling faster than witness sync) - Wave-particle duality
(synchronization timing effects) - Entanglement (correlated pattern
cycles) - Decoherence (pattern interaction disrupting coherence) -
Spectral existence (witnessing degree determines existence)</p>
<p><strong>Key Frameworks:</strong> - <strong>Markov Blankets</strong>:
Interaction boundaries between pattern scales - <strong>Markov Relevancy
Horizon (MRH)</strong>: Contextual existence boundaries -
<strong>Coherence</strong>: Pattern stability measures - <strong>Field
Effects</strong>: Distributed Intent influence</p>
<p><strong>What Synchronism Does NOT Model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Current Limitations:</strong> - Gravity (acknowledged gap—no
speculative mechanisms offered) - Dark matter/energy (insufficient
framework) - Quantum gravity unification (premature) - String theory
integration (speculative)</p>
<p>Rather than propose unsupported mechanisms, we acknowledge these gaps
honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Epistemic Humility</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism doesn’t claim to: - Replace physics (we defer to GR, QM
for their domains) - Explain “why” teleologically (no purpose, just
dynamics) - Make consciousness fundamental (it’s emergent like
everything else) - Unify all forces (gravity remains unsolved)</p>
<p>Synchronism DOES offer: - Non-anthropocentric perspective on
observer-dependent phenomena - Computational framework for pattern
dynamics - Potentially testable predictions (where framework is
complete) - Conceptual tools: MRH, spectral existence, witnessing vs
observation</p>
<p><strong>The Invitation</strong></p>
<p>This document presents a radical alternative to observer-based
physics. Not compatible with anthropocentric science—orthogonal to it.
Like heliocentrism didn’t refine epicycles but made them irrelevant,
Synchronism doesn’t refine measurement paradoxes—it makes the observer
premise secondary to pattern dynamics.</p>
<p>Read with skepticism. Demand rigor. Accept nothing on authority. Ask:
“Is this less wrong than what we have?” not “Is this true?”</p>
<p><strong>Remember: All models are wrong. This one too.</strong></p>
