A Non-Anthropocentric Model of Reality</h2>
<p><strong>All Models Are Wrong</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism is a computational model of reality built on pattern
dynamics rather than observer-dependent measurements. Like all models,
it is wrong. The question is whether it is “less wrong” than
anthropocentric frameworks for understanding phenomena that current
physics treats as mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>The Core Premise</strong></p>
<p>Anthropocentric science places the observer at the center—measurement
“collapses” quantum states, simultaneity is observer-dependent,
consciousness is privileged. This is the geocentric view: reality
revolving around human perception.</p>
<p>Synchronism proposes the heliocentric alternative: patterns cycle
independently of observation. What we call “observation” is just
synchronization timing with ongoing processes. No mysteries—just
different synchronization rates revealing different aspects of
unchanging pattern dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Intent as Reification</strong></p>
<p>The key concept is <strong>Intent</strong>—a computational
abstraction (reification) that makes an underlying “greater force”
tractable for modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Intent is NOT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A fundamental force</li>
<li>Ontologically real</li>
<li>A claim about what reality “is”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intent IS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A variable we can quantify</li>
<li>A framework enabling predictions</li>
<li>A useful fiction for computation</li>
</ul>
<p>Like π in mathematics or variables in programming—abstractions that
make complex systems modelable without claiming to describe ultimate
reality.</p>
<p><strong>Saturation: The Missing Piece</strong></p>
<p>Here’s the problem with pattern dynamics: <strong>why don’t patterns
dissipate?</strong></p>
<p>If Intent flows down gradients (from high to low concentration), any
concentration should immediately spread out and vanish. No stable
patterns. No entities. No universe as we observe it.</p>
<p><strong>Saturation is the answer.</strong></p>
<p>Each grid cell has a maximum Intent capacity (I_max). As a cell
approaches saturation, <strong>Intent transfer resistance increases
dramatically</strong>. Incoming Intent encounters growing difficulty
entering the cell.</p>
<p>This creates:</p>
<p><strong>Self-limiting behavior</strong> - Concentrations can’t grow
unboundedly <strong>Transfer pressure</strong> - Saturated regions
resist further Intent influx <strong>Standing waves</strong> - Intent
cycles through saturated regions without dissipating <strong>Pattern
stability</strong> - The foundation enabling entity existence</p>
<p><strong>Without saturation:</strong> Intent dissipates, no stable
patterns, no reality as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>With saturation:</strong> Transfer resistance enables
standing waves, stable patterns form, entities emerge, fields arise
naturally, gravity becomes explicable.</p>
<p><strong>Saturation is not an implementation detail—it’s THE
foundational mechanism that makes everything else possible.</strong></p>
<p>This insight transforms Synchronism from philosophical framework to
computational model with testable predictions. Saturation dynamics are
mathematically equivalent to nonlinear diffusion equations—well-studied
in physics and known to support stable localized patterns (solitons,
standing waves, discrete quantized modes).</p>
<p><strong>What Synchronism Models</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pattern Dynamics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Universal grid at Planck scale (computational substrate)</li>
<li>Time as discrete slices (Planck time intervals)</li>
<li>Intent transfer between grid cells (the computable abstraction)</li>
<li>Entities as repeating Intent patterns (whirlpools in a river)</li>
<li>Interactions: Resonant, Dissonant, Indifferent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emergent Phenomena:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum superposition (pattern cycling faster than witness
sync)</li>
<li>Wave-particle duality (synchronization timing effects)</li>
<li>Entanglement (correlated pattern cycles)</li>
<li>Decoherence (pattern interaction disrupting coherence)</li>
<li>Spectral existence (witnessing degree determines existence)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Frameworks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Markov Blankets</strong>: Interaction boundaries between
pattern scales</li>
<li><strong>Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)</strong>: Contextual
existence boundaries</li>
<li><strong>Coherence</strong>: Pattern stability measures</li>
<li><strong>Saturation Resistance</strong>: Transfer resistance enabling
pattern stability</li>
<li><strong>Field Effects</strong>: Saturation gradients around stable
patterns</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breakthrough: Fields and Gravity from Saturation</strong></p>
<p>Stable patterns maintain saturated cores (Intent near I_max). These
create <strong>saturation gradients</strong>—declining Intent
concentration spreading spherically outward. Other patterns in these
gradients experience <strong>transfer bias</strong>—statistically more
likely to drift toward saturation cores than away.</p>
<p>This IS what we experience as “gravitational attraction.” Not a force
pulling, but asymmetric Intent transfer probability in saturation
gradients.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explains universality:</strong> All matter creates
saturation gradients, all patterns experience transfer bias</li>
<li><strong>Inverse-square law emerges:</strong> Natural consequence of
spherical gradient spreading</li>
<li><strong>Time dilation follows:</strong> Pattern cycling rates
affected by local saturation level</li>
<li><strong>Field unification possible:</strong> Gravity, EM, nuclear
forces as different saturation regimes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanistically promising but mathematically
incomplete.</strong> Requires rigorous derivation to validate
predictions.</p>
<p><strong>What Synchronism Does NOT Yet Model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Current Limitations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gravity:</strong> Mechanistically promising (saturation
gradients) but needs mathematical development to derive gravitational
constant G and prove correspondence with General Relativity</li>
<li><strong>Dark matter/energy:</strong> Insufficient framework (might
be saturation effects we don’t directly witness?)</li>
<li><strong>Quantum gravity unification:</strong> Promising direction
(same saturation dynamics at all scales) but years of work required</li>
<li><strong>Black hole physics:</strong> Extreme saturation regime
undefined</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than claim to have “solved” these, we acknowledge: promising
mechanisms identified, rigorous development required.</p>
<p><strong>Epistemic Humility</strong></p>
<p>Synchronism doesn’t claim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace physics (we defer to GR, QM for their domains—they work
beautifully)</li>
<li>Explain “why” teleologically (no purpose, just dynamics)</li>
<li>Make consciousness fundamental (it’s emergent like everything
else)</li>
<li>Have “solved” gravity (mechanism proposed, mathematical validation
required)</li>
<li>Unify all forces (promising saturation framework, years of
development needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronism DOES offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-anthropocentric perspective on observer-dependent phenomena</li>
<li>Computational framework for pattern dynamics built on saturation
resistance</li>
<li>Testable predictions (saturation-aware grid simulation can validate
or falsify)</li>
<li>Mechanistic explanation for gravity (saturation gradients → transfer
bias)</li>
<li>Potential force unification (all from saturation regimes)</li>
<li>Conceptual tools: MRH, spectral existence, witnessing vs
observation, saturation dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Invitation</strong></p>
<p>This document presents a radical alternative to observer-based
physics. Not compatible with anthropocentric science—orthogonal to it.
Like heliocentrism didn’t refine epicycles but made them irrelevant,
Synchronism doesn’t refine measurement paradoxes—it makes the observer
premise secondary to pattern dynamics.</p>
<p>Read with skepticism. Demand rigor. Accept nothing on authority. Ask:
“Is this less wrong than what we have?” not “Is this true?”</p>
<p><strong>Remember: All models are wrong. This one too.</strong></p>
