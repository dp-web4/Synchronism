# Remaining Radicalization Tasks

## Completed
✅ Geocentric/heliocentric framing in Introduction
✅ Anthropocentric science as belief system in Perspective
✅ Intent as reification for computability
✅ Entities as repeating patterns (emergence section)
✅ Simplified entity interactions to 3 modes

## Still To Do

### 1. Spectral Existence (04-fundamental-concepts/10-spectral-existence/spectral_existence.md)

Replace current content with:

```markdown
## 4.10 Spectral Existence

Existence is not binary (exists/doesn't exist). Existence is spectral—determined by the degree and persistence of witnessing interactions.

**Existence as Witnessing Degree**

An entity exists to the extent it is witnessed (interacted with) by other entities:
- **High existence**: Many persistent witnessing interactions
- **Moderate existence**: Fewer or transient interactions
- **Low existence**: Minimal witnessing interactions

**Not Observer-Dependent Reality**

This is NOT anthropocentric "observer creates reality." This is: patterns that interact more with other patterns have higher existence on the spectrum.

A rock has high existence because countless patterns (photons, air molecules, gravitational fields, etc.) constantly witness (interact with) it. A virtual particle has low existence because few patterns witness it before it vanishes.

**Witnessing = Physical Interaction**

Witnessing is physical interaction between Intent patterns. No consciousness required. An electron "witnesses" a photon by interacting with it. That interaction degree determines the photon's existence to the electron.
```

### 2. MRH - Contextual Existence (04-fundamental-concepts/09-markov-relevancy/markov_relevancy.md)

Add to end of MRH section:

```markdown
**MRH-Bounded Existence**

Entities exist only within their MRH—the scope of meaningful interaction:

- An organism exists contextually to its cells (cells can witness it)
- A cell exists contextually to molecules within it (molecules can witness it)
- A galaxy exists contextually to stars within it (stars can witness it)

**No Universal Existence**

There is no absolute existence across all scales. Each entity's existence is bounded by its interaction horizon. Outside that horizon, spectral existence → 0.

An atom doesn't "exist" to a galaxy (no witnessing interaction). A galaxy doesn't "exist" to an atom. They occupy different MRHs.
```

### 3. Gravity Section (05-quantum-macro/14-gravity/gravity.md)

REPLACE ENTIRE FILE with:

```markdown
## 5.14 Gravity

Synchronism does not currently offer a coherent model of gravity beyond acknowledging it as an emergent phenomenon from Intent pattern dynamics.

**What We Can Say:**
- Gravity appears to be a universal interaction affecting all Intent patterns
- The mechanism remains speculative within the Synchronism framework
- Any grid-based models are premature without mathematical foundation

**What We Cannot Say:**
- Specific mechanisms for gravitational attraction
- Black hole dynamics in Synchronism terms
- Quantum gravity unification
- Testable predictions distinct from General Relativity

**Epistemic Humility**

Gravity represents a current limitation of the Synchronism model. Rather than proposing unsupported mechanisms, we acknowledge this gap.

A future coherent gravity model must:
- Emerge from fundamental Intent dynamics
- Make testable predictions
- Avoid anthropocentric observer-dependence

Until such a model exists, we defer to General Relativity for gravitational phenomena while recognizing it as an anthropocentric (measurement-based) framework.
```

### 4. Remove Unsupported Applications

Search for and remove/simplify:
- Quantum error correction claims (no mechanism provided)
- Technology speculation without foundation
- "Potential applications" that are just wishful thinking

Keep only applications with clear mechanistic connection to Intent dynamics.

### 5. Update Changelogs

Add to main CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
- [2025-10-04] [Radical Paradigm Shift] Multiple Sections - Radicalization of Synchronism as non-anthropocentric framework (#radicalization-001)
  - Introduction: Added geocentric vs. heliocentric framing, all models are wrong principle
  - Perspective: Reframed all knowledge systems (including science) as belief systems with anthropocentric axiom
  - Intent: Redefined as reification for computability, not ontological reality
  - Entities: Simplified to repeating Intent patterns (whirlpool analogy)
  - Interactions: Reduced to three modes (resonant, dissonant, indifferent)
  - Spectral Existence: Clarified as witnessing-degree dependent
  - MRH: Added contextual existence boundaries
  - Gravity: Replaced speculation with epistemic humility about gaps
  - Removed unsupported applications and anthropocentric language throughout
```

## Philosophy of Radicalization

Synchronism is NOT refining anthropocentric science—it's making the observer premise irrelevant.

Just as heliocentrism didn't improve epicycles but made them unnecessary, Synchronism doesn't fix QM observer effects—it dissolves them by removing the anthropocentric assumption.
