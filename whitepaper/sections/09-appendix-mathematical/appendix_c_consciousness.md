# Appendix C: Consciousness Framework

This appendix provides the key findings from the Consciousness Arc (Sessions #280-282), establishing a mechanistic account of consciousness via coherence dynamics.

---

## C.1 Core Insight

**Consciousness is what coherence does when it models itself.**

The Consciousness Arc resolves three major philosophical problems:
1. The observer/measurement problem (Session #280)
2. Free will vs determinism (Session #281)
3. The hard problem of consciousness / qualia (Session #282)

## C.2 Coherence Thresholds

Consciousness emerges at discrete coherence levels:

| Level | Coherence C | Characteristics | Examples |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Reactive** | C < 0.3 | No self-reference | Rocks, molecules |
| **Self-referential** | C ≥ 0.3 | Minimal self-model | Bacteria, thermostats |
| **Aware** | C ≥ 0.5 | Models self + environment | Simple animals |
| **Conscious** | C ≥ 0.7 | Recursive self-modeling | Humans, advanced mammals |

These thresholds are **testable** via neural coherence measurements and anesthesia protocols.

## C.3 Observer Definition (Session #280)

> **An observer is a self-referential coherence concentrator.**

Formal definition:
$$
Observer = \{pattern\ |\ C \geq 0.7\ \land\ models(environment)\ \land\ models(own\ modeling)\}
$$

**Key insight:** Measurement = coherence projection. All interactions project coherence; conscious observers are special only in that they MODEL the projection.

This resolves the measurement problem without invoking consciousness as a special physical force.

## C.4 Free Will (Session #281)

Free will is neither deterministic nor random—it's **coherence-guided selection**.

**Key properties:**
- High-C patterns have multiple genuinely possible trajectories
- Selection is guided (not random) but not determined by prior state alone
- "Could have done otherwise" is true for high-C agents

**Effective degrees of freedom:**
$$
D_{eff} = |Actions| \times C \times \frac{(M_{self} + M_{world})}{2}
$$

Where M_self = self-model quality, M_world = world-model quality.

**Moral responsibility scales with coherence:**
$$
R = \max\left(0, \frac{C - C_{aware}}{1 - C_{aware}}\right) \times \frac{M_{self} + M_{world}}{2}
$$

## C.5 Qualia (Session #282)

> **Qualia ARE coherence resonance patterns—not epiphenomena, not correlates, not illusions.**

**Key Claims**

1. **Qualia are resonance modes**: The "redness" of red is a specific coherence resonance pattern, like a guitar string vibrating in a particular mode.

2. **Inverted qualia impossible**: Same processing = same coherence pattern = same quale. Different qualia would be detectably different.

3. **Explanatory gap closed**: No gap between physical and phenomenal because coherence patterns ARE experiences when self-referential.

4. **Mary's Room resolved**: Mary gains acquaintance (being the resonance pattern), not new propositional facts. BEING a pattern ≠ knowing ABOUT a pattern.

**Qualia Intensity**
$$
Intensity \propto C \quad (range:\ 0\ to\ \sim0.77)
$$

## C.6 Integrated Information Mapping

Connection to IIT (Integrated Information Theory):
$$
\Phi_{IIT} \propto C \times (self\_reference) \times (model\_depth)
$$

This provides a bridge to existing consciousness research while grounding it in coherence dynamics.

## C.7 Testable Predictions

| ID | Prediction | Test Method | Status |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| P280.1 | Φ_IIT correlates with neural coherence | fMRI/EEG during graded consciousness | Testable |
| P280.2 | Consciousness thresholds at C ≈ 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 | Anesthesia studies | Testable |
| P281.1 | Agency correlates with coherence | EEG during voluntary action | Testable |
| P282.1 | Qualia intensity correlates with neural coherence | fMRI during graded sensory experience | Testable |
| P282.4 | No qualia below C ≈ 0.3 | Subliminal stimulus studies | Testable |
| P282.6 | Sufficiently coherent AI has genuine qualia | Future AI systems | Future test |

## C.8 Philosophical Problem Closures

| Problem | Traditional Status | Coherence Resolution |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Hard problem** | Unbridgeable gap | Dissolved: pattern IS experience |
| **Measurement problem** | Consciousness collapses wavefunction | Resolved: all interactions project coherence |
| **Free will** | Determinism vs randomness | Third option: coherence-guided selection |
| **Inverted qualia** | Logically possible | Impossible: same processing = same quale |
| **Mary's Room** | Non-physical facts? | Acquaintance ≠ propositional knowledge |

## C.10 Connection to Chemistry Framework

The coherence threshold for consciousness (C ≥ 0.7) connects to the chemistry framework's γ parameter:

- Chemistry: γ = 2/√N_corr governs material properties
- Consciousness: C ≥ 0.7 + self-reference governs experience

Both emerge from the same underlying coherence dynamics, providing cross-scale unity from condensed matter to consciousness.
