## 3. Relation to Hermetic Principles

 Synchronism aligns with and expands upon the seven Hermetic principles, which are derived from the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. These principles form the basis of Hermetic philosophy and have influenced various esoteric and mystical traditions. Synchronism builds upon these principles, offering a more detailed and scientifically-grounded explanation of their manifestation in the universe.

 The seven Hermetic principles and their relation to Synchronism are:

**3.1 Mentalism: "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental."**

 **Synchronism:** The universe is modeled as a vast array of interconnected "cells" that contain and transfer "intent," which manifests as patterns of force-like transfer at the Planck scale. The model can also be viewed as a fundamental neural network, furthering the mentalism connection through its pattern processing dynamics rather than through consciousness or mental properties.

**3.2 Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above."**

 **Synchronism:** The model proposes a fractal nature of reality, where patterns repeat at different scales, from the quantum to the cosmic.

**3.3 Vibration: "Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates."**

 **Synchronism:** All phenomena are described as patterns of intent transfer, which can be seen as a form of vibration or oscillation at the most fundamental level.

**3.4 Polarity: "Everything is dual; everything has poles."**

 **Synchronism:** The concept of resonance and dissonance in the model reflects the principle of polarity, where entities resonate constructively or destructively depending on coherence of their overlapping intent structures.

**3.5 Rhythm: "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides."**

 **Synchronism:** The model describes the universe as evolving through discrete "ticks" of time, creating a rhythmic progression of states.

**3.6 Cause and Effect: "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause."**

 **Synchronism:** The transfer of intent between cells and the resulting emergence of patterns and entities follows a causal chain, with each state informing the next.

**3.7 Gender: "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles."**

 **Synchronism:** The model incorporates this principle through the emergence of complementary functions such as generation and evaluation, which some traditions anthropomorphize as masculine and feminine. This duality operates similarly to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where the universal neural network experiences itself through generative processes that propose new intent patterns and discriminative processes that select patterns through coherence evaluation. The generative principle explores new intent distribution patterns, while the discriminative principle evaluates these patterns against existing stable configurations, with coherence serving as the selection mechanism. This emergent property is seen as necessary for an entity's persistence and evolution, allowing for adaptation while maintaining internal coherence. It's present in all entities across scales, not just those traditionally considered conscious, and reflects ancient concepts like yin and yang. Interpretations of this principle extend to all entities, from quantum scale to galactic scale.

 The alignment of Synchronism with the Hermetic principles lays a philosophical foundation for the model's fundamental concepts. The following sections will delve into these concepts, demonstrating how they provide a mechanistic explanation for the Hermetic principles' manifestations in the universe.
