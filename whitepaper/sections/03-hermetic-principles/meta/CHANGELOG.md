### 2025-10-04 | Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (epistemic-guardian) | MODIFY
- **Description**: Removed "mental energy" interpretation from Mentalism principle, replaced with "pattern processing dynamics"
- **Rationale**: Epistemic consistency review identified drift toward consciousness-based interpretation of intent. Intent is a non-conscious property like electric charge, not mental or psychological. Clarified that mentalism connection comes through pattern processing dynamics, not through consciousness or mental properties.
