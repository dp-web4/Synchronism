## 1. Introduction

**All Models Are Wrong**

Synchronism begins with a fundamental acknowledgment: all models of reality are wrong. Science, religion, philosophy—each is a belief system built on unprovable axioms. Synchronism itself is wrong. The question is not "which model is true?" but "which model is less wrong for understanding the mysteries that current frameworks cannot adequately explain?"

**The Anthropocentric Premise**

All human knowledge systems share a common foundation: the anthropocentric premise. Human science, from quantum mechanics to relativity, places the "observer" as a fundamental concept. This is the geocentric view of reality—humans at the center, with increasingly complex mechanisms (epicycles) constructed to explain observed phenomena while preserving the centrality of human observation.

**Anthropocentric Science (Geocentric View):**
- Observer as fundamental to reality
- Measurement "collapses" quantum states
- Observer-dependent simultaneity in relativity
- Consciousness as privileged or special
- "Mysteries" requiring ever-more complex explanations

**Synchronism (Heliocentric View):**
- Patterns cycle independently of observation
- Witnessing is synchronization with existing cycles
- No privileged observers—all entities are pattern interactions
- Consciousness as emergent pattern like any other
- "Mysteries" dissolve through paradigm shift, not added complexity

Just as heliocentrism didn't refine epicycles but made them irrelevant, Synchronism doesn't refine observer-based physics—it makes the observer premise itself secondary to pattern dynamics.

**The CRT Analogy: Measurement as Synchronization**

Consider a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) display. An electron beam continuously scans across a phosphor screen. When you observe it at human frame rates (~30 Hz), you see a stable picture. Speed up your observation and the picture flickers, breaks into bands. Observe at pixel-duration timing and you see a single moving dot at unpredictable locations.

**Nothing about the screen changed.** Only your synchronization timing with the ongoing process changed.

Anthropocentric physics treats this as mysterious: "How does observation affect what we see?" Synchronism reveals it as trivial: patterns cycle continuously; what you witness depends on when/how you synchronize with them.

**The Pendulum Clock Analogy: Instrument Effects vs. Reality**

Relativistic time dilation was proven by flying atomic clocks on airplanes in opposite directions. They diverged by the predicted amount, confirming Einstein's theory.

Now try this: Put a pendulum clock in a centrifuge and run it. Compare it to a stationary pendulum clock. They will diverge by a readily predictable amount based on centrifugal force affecting the pendulum's swing period.

**Would that prove "centrifuge time dilation"?**

Of course not. It would prove that the variable we're controlling (centrifugal force) has a predictable effect on the instrument we're using to measure "passage of time."

If we were forced to rely exclusively on pendulum clocks in centrifuges, accounting for "centrifuge time dilation" would be essential for accurate timekeeping. We'd build elaborate mathematical frameworks to predict and correct for it. We might even call it fundamental to reality.

**But it's just an instrument effect.**

Anthropocentric physics assumes atomic clocks measure "time itself." Synchronism suggests they measure pattern synchronization—and like pendulum clocks affected by centrifugal force, atomic clocks are affected by velocity and gravity because these alter the fundamental pattern dynamics they synchronize with.

The measurements are real. The predictions work. But what's being measured might not be what we think.

**Intent as Computational Reification**

The key concept in Synchronism is "Intent"—a reification of the abstract "greater force" for computational tractability. Intent is NOT the force itself, nor is it ontologically real. It is a modeling abstraction that makes the underlying dynamics computable and testable.

Think of Intent as a variable in a computer program: it represents something deeper (the "greater force") but provides a framework we can actually work with mathematically. This reification allows quantification and prediction without claiming to describe ultimate reality.

**Scope and Purpose**

Synchronism proposes a non-anthropocentric foundation from which quantum mechanics, relativity, consciousness, and other phenomena emerge as observer-dependent interpretations. It is comprehensive in scope but acknowledges its status as a model—a useful fiction that may be "less wrong" than anthropocentric frameworks for certain mysteries.

**Beyond Multiple Observers**

Synchronism models reality from a single reference frame—not because there is a privileged observer, but because the model describes pattern dynamics directly rather than through observer-dependent measurements.

**Pattern Dynamics vs. Observer Effects:**
- Anthropocentric physics: Multiple observers with conflicting measurements require reconciliation
- Synchronism: Patterns cycle independently; "observers" are just other patterns synchronizing

**Witnessing Without Observation:**
What anthropocentric models call "observation" (implying consciousness and measurement affecting reality), Synchronism calls "witnessing" (pattern synchronization). A witness is itself an intent pattern interacting with other patterns—not separate from reality, but part of the same pattern dynamics.

**No Absolute Simultaneity Claim:**
Synchronism's single-frame approach is a modeling choice for computational tractability, not a claim about absolute time. Observer-dependent effects in relativity emerge at appropriate scales—they are real measured phenomena. Synchronism simply proposes a deeper substrate where these emerge from pattern dynamics rather than being fundamental.

**Limitations and Perspectives**

 The limitations of individual perspectives, as highlighted in the parable of the blind men and the elephant, underscore the need for a comprehensive model like Synchronism that strives for a holistic understanding of reality. However, Synchronism acknowledges the practical usefulness of limited-perspective analysis.

 This is addressed with concepts like [Markov Relevancy Horizon](#mrh), [Abstraction](#abstraction), [Witness](#witness-effect) and Experience as part of the Synchronism model. These tools are not replacements for traditional scientific methods but extensions that accommodate multi-scale coherence and fractal analysis.

**Mathematical Formalism**

 For Synchronism to be a useful and relevant model, it is necessary to introduce formal mathematical treatments for its key concepts. The mathematical approach combines discrete dynamics (for grid-based intent transfer), differential equations (for field effects), and information theory (for coherence measures). In order to keep the core document as concise as possible, the complete mathematical formalism is introduced separately in [Appendix A](#appendix-a).
