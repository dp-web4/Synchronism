## Synchronism: A Non-Anthropocentric Model of Reality

**All Models Are Wrong**

Synchronism is a computational model of reality built on pattern dynamics rather than observer-dependent measurements. Like all models, it is wrong. The question is whether it is "less wrong" than anthropocentric frameworks for understanding phenomena that current physics treats as mysterious.

**The Core Premise**

Anthropocentric science places the observer at the center—measurement "collapses" quantum states, simultaneity is observer-dependent, consciousness is privileged. This is the geocentric view: reality revolving around human perception.

Synchronism proposes the heliocentric alternative: patterns cycle independently of observation. What we call "observation" is just synchronization timing with ongoing processes. No mysteries—just different synchronization rates revealing different aspects of unchanging pattern dynamics.

**Intent as Reification**

The key concept is **Intent**—a computational abstraction (reification) that makes an underlying "greater force" tractable for modeling.

**Intent is NOT:**

- A fundamental force
- Ontologically real
- A claim about what reality "is"

**Intent IS:**

- A variable we can quantify
- A framework enabling predictions
- A useful fiction for computation

Like π in mathematics or variables in programming—abstractions that make complex systems modelable without claiming to describe ultimate reality.

**Saturation: The Missing Piece**

Here's the problem with pattern dynamics: **why don't patterns dissipate?**

If Intent flows down gradients (from high to low concentration), any concentration should immediately spread out and vanish. No stable patterns. No entities. No universe as we observe it.

**Saturation is the answer.**

Each grid cell has a maximum Intent capacity (I_max). As a cell approaches saturation, **Intent transfer resistance increases dramatically**. Incoming Intent encounters growing difficulty entering the cell.

This creates:

**Self-limiting behavior** - Concentrations can't grow unboundedly
**Transfer pressure** - Saturated regions resist further Intent influx
**Standing waves** - Intent cycles through saturated regions without dissipating
**Pattern stability** - The foundation enabling entity existence

**Without saturation:** Intent dissipates, no stable patterns, no reality as we know it.

**With saturation:** Transfer resistance enables standing waves, stable patterns form, entities emerge, fields arise naturally, gravity becomes explicable.

**Saturation is not an implementation detail—it's THE foundational mechanism that makes everything else possible.**

This insight transforms Synchronism from philosophical framework to computational model with testable predictions. Saturation dynamics are mathematically equivalent to nonlinear diffusion equations—well-studied in physics and known to support stable localized patterns (solitons, standing waves, discrete quantized modes).

**What Synchronism Models**

**Pattern Dynamics:**

- Universal grid at Planck scale (computational substrate)
- Time as discrete slices (Planck time intervals)
- Intent transfer between grid cells (the computable abstraction)
- Entities as repeating Intent patterns (whirlpools in a river)
- Interactions: Resonant, Dissonant, Indifferent

**Emergent Phenomena:**

- Quantum superposition (pattern cycling faster than witness sync)
- Wave-particle duality (synchronization timing effects)
- Entanglement (correlated pattern cycles)
- Decoherence (pattern interaction disrupting coherence)
- Spectral existence (witnessing degree determines existence)

**Key Frameworks:**

- **Markov Blankets**: Interaction boundaries between pattern scales
- **Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)**: Contextual existence boundaries
- **Coherence**: Pattern stability measures
- **Saturation Resistance**: Transfer resistance enabling pattern stability
- **Field Effects**: Saturation gradients around stable patterns

**Breakthrough: Fields and Gravity from Saturation**

Stable patterns maintain saturated cores (Intent near I_max). These create **saturation gradients**—declining Intent concentration spreading spherically outward. Other patterns in these gradients experience **transfer bias**—statistically more likely to drift toward saturation cores than away.

This IS what we experience as "gravitational attraction." Not a force pulling, but asymmetric Intent transfer probability in saturation gradients.

**Why this matters:**

- **Explains universality:** All matter creates saturation gradients, all patterns experience transfer bias
- **Inverse-square law emerges:** Natural consequence of spherical gradient spreading
- **Time dilation follows:** Pattern cycling rates affected by local saturation level
- **Field unification possible:** Gravity, EM, nuclear forces as different saturation regimes

**Mechanistically promising but mathematically incomplete.** Requires rigorous derivation to validate predictions.

**What Synchronism Does NOT Yet Model**

**Current Limitations:**

- **Gravity:** Mechanistically promising (saturation gradients) but needs mathematical development to derive gravitational constant G and prove correspondence with General Relativity
- **Black hole physics:** Extreme saturation regime undefined
- **Quantum gravity unification:** Promising direction (same saturation dynamics at all scales) but years of work required

**Research Progress (Dec 2025):**

- **Dark matter:** Coherence model tested on 175 SPARC galaxies (52% success, 81.8% on dwarfs). MOND-Synchronism unification: a₀ = cH₀/(2π). See [Section 5.15](#dark-matter-dark-energy-and-coherence).
- **Dark energy:** Emergent from coherence: ρ_DE = ρ_m(1-C)/C. Cosmic C constrained (not derived) from w = -1. S₈ = 0.763 predicted, matching lensing surveys.
- **Status:** Promising empirical validation but 46% SPARC failure rate in massive galaxies. Not claiming "solved"—mechanism tested, boundaries identified.

**Epistemic Humility**

Synchronism doesn't claim to:

- Replace physics (we defer to GR, QM for their domains—they work beautifully)
- Explain "why" teleologically (no purpose, just dynamics)
- Make consciousness fundamental (it's emergent like everything else)
- Have "solved" gravity (mechanism proposed, mathematical validation required)
- Unify all forces (promising saturation framework, years of development needed)

Synchronism DOES offer:

- Non-anthropocentric perspective on observer-dependent phenomena
- Computational framework for pattern dynamics built on saturation resistance
- Testable predictions (saturation-aware grid simulation can validate or falsify)
- Mechanistic explanation for gravity (saturation gradients → transfer bias)
- Potential force unification (all from saturation regimes)
- Conceptual tools: MRH, spectral existence, witnessing vs observation, saturation dynamics

**The Invitation**

This document presents a radical alternative to observer-based physics. Not compatible with anthropocentric science—orthogonal to it. Like heliocentrism didn't refine epicycles but made them irrelevant, Synchronism doesn't refine measurement paradoxes—it makes the observer premise secondary to pattern dynamics.

Read with skepticism. Demand rigor. Accept nothing on authority. Ask: "Is this less wrong than what we have?" not "Is this true?"

**Remember: All models are wrong. This one too.**
