### 2025-10-04 | Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (epistemic-guardian) | MODIFY
- **Description**: Multiple epistemic consistency corrections in 05-witness-effect and 13-life-cognition subsections
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive review identified critical drift instances:
  - 05-witness-effect: Replaced "consciousness chooses" with "consciousness synchronizes with aspects determined by interaction patterns" to remove agency implication. Changed "No reality construction" to "Reality independence" for positive framing without QM terminology.
  - 13-life-cognition: Changed "Observer participation: Conscious observers participate in creating reality" to "Witness synchronization" - critical fix contradicting single-observer model. Changed "Intentionality" to "Pattern directedness" and "Intentional behavior" to "Pattern-directed behavior" to avoid consciousness-loaded philosophical terminology. Maintains distinction between witnessing (passive synchronization) and observation (active/creative).
