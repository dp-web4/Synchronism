## 5.14 Gravity

Synchronism does not currently offer a coherent model of gravity beyond acknowledging it as an emergent phenomenon from Intent pattern dynamics.

**What We Can Say:**

- Gravity appears to be a universal interaction affecting all Intent patterns
- The mechanism remains speculative within the Synchronism framework
- Any "grid distortion" or "field depletion" models are premature without mathematical foundation

**What We Cannot Say:**

- Specific mechanisms for gravitational attraction
- Black hole dynamics in Synchronism terms
- Quantum gravity unification
- Testable predictions distinct from General Relativity

**Epistemic Humility**

Gravity represents a current limitation of the Synchronism model. Rather than proposing unsupported mechanisms (grid distortions, computational load, density wells), we acknowledge this gap.

A future coherent gravity model must:
- Emerge from fundamental Intent dynamics
- Make testable predictions
- Avoid anthropocentric observer-dependence
- Be mathematically rigorous

**Current Understanding**

Until such a model exists, we defer to General Relativity for gravitational phenomena while recognizing it as an anthropocentric (measurement-based) framework. GR describes what we measure; Synchronism might eventually explain why those measurements occurâ€”but not yet.

The mystery of gravity remains. That's honest science.
