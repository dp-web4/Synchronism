## 2025-08-22 - Relocation to Web4 Context

**Proposal**: #004  
**Type**: Restructure  
**Decision**: Approved (88% approval)

### Changes
- Archived implementation-specific content to `archive/` directory
- Replaced with minimal principle statement about information system dynamics
- Full implementation details relocated to Web4 documentation

### Rationale
- Synchronism should contain MRH-transcendent principles
- Web4 should contain MRH-specific implementations
- Previous content mixed universal principles with web-centric engineering

### Impact
- Cleaner separation between science and engineering layers
- Improved philosophical clarity
- Better alignment with MRH principles

## 2025-08-22 - Initial Creation

**Proposal**: #003  
**Type**: Addition

Section created to explore compression-trust dynamics as part of fundamental concepts.
