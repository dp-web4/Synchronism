## 4.4 Time as Planck-Timed Slices

**Computational Time Model**

In Synchronism, time is modeled as a series of discrete computational steps or "ticks"—each representing a state transition in the pattern dynamics. This is a modeling choice for tractability, not a claim about time's ontological nature.

Think of it like frame updates in a simulation: each tick advances the universe state by one computational cycle. Whether reality "actually" operates this way remains unknown—but discrete time makes the model computable.

**Discrete Time Model**

 Key aspects of this time model include:

 - **Quantized Progression:** Time advances in discrete units called "ticks," each corresponding to Planck time (approximately 5.39 × 10⁻⁴⁴ seconds). Planck time is theorized to be the smallest meaningful measurement of time in the universe.
- **Universal Slices:** The state of the entire universe at any given tick is referred to as a "slice." Each slice represents a complete snapshot of the intent distribution across all cells in the universe at that moment.
- **Static Slices:** Each slice is fixed and unchanging, representing a static state of the universe.
- **Causal Chain:** The state of each slice is informed by the intent distributions of all preceding states, establishing a causal chain throughout the history of the universe.

**Mathematical Representation**

 - **State Functions:** Universe state U(t) at time t
- **Transition Rules:** U(t+1) = F(U(t))
- **Deterministic Evolution:** Future states determined by current state
- **Conservation Laws:** Total intent preserved across transitions

**Determinism Note**

The model uses deterministic state transitions: U(t+1) = F(U(t)). Each state follows from the previous state according to Intent transfer rules. This doesn't make metaphysical claims about "free will"—it's simply how the computational model operates.

**Understanding Through Analogies**

 - **Film Frames:** Static slices create illusion of motion
- **Computer Clock Cycles:** Synchronized component updates
- **Universal Heartbeat:** Each tick drives the universe forward

 This discrete time model allows for a precise description of how the universe evolves from one state to the next, with each tick representing a fundamental unit of change.
