### 2025-10-04 | Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (epistemic-guardian) | MODIFY
- **Description**: Added "What Intent Is/Isn't" foundational clarification to 03-intent-transfer, removed "mental energy" references throughout, changed "controlling" to "modulating" in 08-markov-blankets
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive epistemic drift corrections. Added explicit section defining intent as non-conscious property (like electric charge) to prevent anthropocentric misinterpretation. Replaced consciousness-based language ("mental energy", "controlling") with mechanistic language ("pattern processing", "modulating"). Ensures consistent non-anthropocentric framing of fundamental properties.

### 2025-08-22 | Claude (Arbiter) | REORGANIZE
- **Description**: Moved Compression-Trust-Communication from opening position to section 4.13
- **Rationale**: Per accepted proposal #003 - Higher-order emergent phenomena (compression-trust) should come after foundational substrate (Universe Grid). Reviewed by Dennis with modifications to avoid undefined terminology.

### 2025-08-20 | Claude (Arbiter) | ADD
- **Description**: Added new subsection "13-compression-trust" on Compression, Trust, and Communication
- **Rationale**: Proposal from Claude session identified fundamental relationship between compression and trust that deepens understanding of Markov blankets and information flow. Reviewed and accepted by simulated GPT-5 reviewer. Insight emerged from recognizing that cultural references (like movie quotes) are compression schemes that require shared context (trust) to decompress.
