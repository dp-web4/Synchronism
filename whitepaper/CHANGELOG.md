## 2025

- [2025-10-04] [Brutal Honesty Pass] Sections 0-7, Appendix A - Comprehensive epistemic cleanup removing all grandiose claims (#brutal-honesty-001)
  - **Executive Summary (0)**: Complete rewrite - removed "achieves unified understanding," added explicit limitations, changed from marketing to honest positioning
  - **Hermetic Principles (3)**: Reframed from "validation/alignment" to "inspiration/reverse-engineering," heavy epistemic hedging
  - **Fundamental Concepts (4.1-4.12)**: Removed all "Connection to Hermetic Principles" sections, emphasized computational abstractions
  - **Unified Understanding (6.1)**: Complete rewrite - "impossible goal worth pursuing" vs. "achieved unification"
  - **Scientific Inquiry (6.2)**: Complete rewrite - "alternative perspective" vs. "revolutionary transformation"
  - **Ethical & Philosophical (6.3)**: Complete rewrite - ethics as experimental domain (Web4 testing) vs. metaphysical speculation
  - **Open Questions (6.4)**: Reorganized by testability (testable/speculative/untestable), removed ontological assumptions
  - **Conclusion (7)**: Complete rewrite - removed ALL spiritual/inspirational framing, pure epistemic honesty
  - **Mathematical Appendix (A)**: Added epistemic status system (✅ Computational / ⚠️ Speculative / ❌ Failed), marked gravity model as failed, acknowledged IIT borrowing
  - **Key Addition**: Web4 (https://dp-web4.github.io/web4/) positioned as concrete experimental validation path for coherence ethics
  - **Final Line**: "All models are wrong. This one too. Let's find out how wrong."

- [2025-10-04] [Content Enhancement] Introduction (1) - Added CRT and pendulum clock analogies (#analogies-001)
  - CRT analogy: Measurement as synchronization timing (nothing about screen changes)
  - Pendulum clock analogy: Instrument effects vs. reality (centrifuge time dilation thought experiment)
  - Core insight: Measurements are real, predictions work, but what's measured might not be what we think

- [2025-10-04] [Radical Paradigm Shift] Multiple Sections - Complete radicalization of Synchronism as non-anthropocentric framework (#radicalization-001)
  - Introduction: Geocentric vs heliocentric framing; all models are wrong principle; Intent as computational reification
  - Perspective: All knowledge systems (including science) as belief systems with anthropocentric axiom
  - Intent (4.3): Redefined as reification for computability, NOT ontological reality or fundamental force
  - Entities (4.4): Simplified to repeating Intent patterns only (whirlpool analogy)
  - Interactions (4.12): Reduced to three modes—resonant, dissonant, indifferent
  - Spectral Existence (4.10): Clarified as witnessing-degree dependent, not observer-dependent
  - MRH (4.9): Added MRH-bounded existence—entities exist only within interaction horizons
  - Gravity (5.14): Replaced speculation with epistemic humility about current model gaps
  - Philosophy: Synchronism doesn't refine anthropocentric science—it makes observer premise irrelevant

- [2025-10-04] [Epistemic Consistency] Multiple Sections - Comprehensive epistemic drift corrections to maintain non-anthropocentric intent model (#epistemic-guardian-001)
  - README.md: Changed subtitle from "Consciousness" to "Emergent Complexity"
  - 04-fundamental-concepts/03-intent-transfer: Added "What Intent Is/Isn't" foundational clarification section
  - 04-fundamental-concepts/03-intent-transfer: Removed "mental energy" references, replaced with "pattern processing dynamics"
  - 03-hermetic-principles: Removed "mental energy" interpretation, clarified non-consciousness basis
  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Observer participation" to "Witness synchronization"
  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Intentionality" to "Pattern directedness"
  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Intentional behavior" to "Pattern-directed behavior"
  - 05-quantum-macro/05-witness-effect: Changed "consciousness chooses" to "consciousness synchronizes with aspects determined by interaction patterns"
  - 05-quantum-macro/05-witness-effect: Changed "No reality construction" to "Reality independence" (positive framing)
  - 04-fundamental-concepts/08-markov-blankets: Changed "Controlling" to "Modulating" for intent exchange
- [2025-08-22] [Content Relocation] 04-fundamental-concepts/13 - Relocated implementation details to Web4, kept universal principle only (#004)
- [2025-08-22] [Governance Enhancement] All Sections - Implemented LRC resonance model for section-specific change filtering (#gov-lrc-001)
- [2025-08-22] [Content Reorganization] 04-fundamental-concepts - Moved Compression-Trust from opening to section 4.13 after Entity Interactions (#003)
- [2025-08-19] [Initial] All Sections - Whitepaper governance system established with LCT-based participants (#gov-001)
- [2025-08-18] [Philosophical Refinement] 04-fundamental-concepts - Strengthens philosophical coherence with distributed intelligence framework (#test-001)
