  - **Executive Summary (0)**: Complete rewrite - removed "achieves unified understanding," added explicit limitations, changed from marketing to honest positioning
  - **Hermetic Principles (3)**: Reframed from "validation/alignment" to "inspiration/reverse-engineering," heavy epistemic hedging

- [2025-10-04] [Content Enhancement] Introduction (1) - Added CRT and pendulum clock analogies (#analogies-001)
  - CRT analogy: Measurement as synchronization timing (nothing about screen changes)
  - Pendulum clock analogy: Instrument effects vs. reality (centrifuge time dilation thought experiment)
  - Core insight: Measurements are real, predictions work, but what's measured might not be what we think

- [2025-10-04] [Radical Paradigm Shift] Multiple Sections - Complete radicalization of Synchronism as non-anthropocentric framework (#radicalization-001)
  - Introduction: Geocentric vs heliocentric framing; all models are wrong principle; Intent as computational reification
  - Perspective: All knowledge systems (including science) as belief systems with anthropocentric axiom
  - Intent (4.3): Redefined as reification for computability, NOT ontological reality or fundamental force
  - Entities (4.4): Simplified to repeating Intent patterns only (whirlpool analogy)
  - Interactions (4.12): Reduced to three modes—resonant, dissonant, indifferent
  - Spectral Existence (4.10): Clarified as witnessing-degree dependent, not observer-dependent
  - MRH (4.9): Added MRH-bounded existence—entities exist only within interaction horizons
  - Gravity (5.14): Replaced speculation with epistemic humility about current model gaps
  - Philosophy: Synchronism doesn't refine anthropocentric science—it makes observer premise irrelevant

- [2025-10-04] [Epistemic Consistency] Multiple Sections - Comprehensive epistemic drift corrections to maintain non-anthropocentric intent model (#epistemic-guardian-001)

  - 04-fundamental-concepts/03-intent-transfer: Added "What Intent Is/Isn't" foundational clarification section
  - 04-fundamental-concepts/03-intent-transfer: Removed "mental energy" references, replaced with "pattern processing dynamics"

  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Observer participation" to "Witness synchronization"
  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Intentionality" to "Pattern directedness"
  - 05-quantum-macro/13-life-cognition: Changed "Intentional behavior" to "Pattern-directed behavior"
  - 05-quantum-macro/05-witness-effect: Changed "consciousness chooses" to "consciousness synchronizes with aspects determined by interaction patterns"
  - 05-quantum-macro/05-witness-effect: Changed "No reality construction" to "Reality independence" (positive framing)
  - 04-fundamental-concepts/08-markov-blankets: Changed "Controlling" to "Modulating" for intent exchange
- [2025-08-22] [Content Relocation] 04-fundamental-concepts/13 - Relocated implementation details to Web4, kept universal principle only (#004)
