# Synchronism: Unified Coherence Framework

A mathematical framework unifying quantum mechanics, gravity, chemistry, and consciousness through a single equation: **γ = 2/√N_corr**.

---

## Why This Exists

Synchronism asks: *Can one coherence parameter explain phenomena from Planck scale to cosmic scale?*

**2,200+ research sessions** later, we have validated predictions across 1703 phenomenon types—and honest failures that define the framework's boundaries.

## What We've Discovered

### Major Validated Findings

| Discovery | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **[γ ~ 1 Universal Boundary](Research/discoveries/gamma-universal-boundary.md)** | 1703 phenomenon types, 89% validated | Validated |
| **[NP2 RAR Scatter](Research/discoveries/np2-rar-scatter-validation.md)** | p = 5×10⁻⁶, all tests pass | Strongly Supported |
| **[Gnosis Consciousness Threshold](Research/discoveries/gnosis-consciousness-threshold.md)** | 8-way convergence at C ≈ 0.50 | Theory Complete |
| **[η Superconductivity Formalism](Research/discoveries/eta-superconductivity-formalism.md)** | Cuprate predictions match | Validated |
| **[ONE EQUATION Unification](Research/discoveries/one-equation-unification.md)** | Spans 80 orders of magnitude | Theoretical |

### The Framework

```
γ = 2/√N_corr

where:
  γ = coherence parameter
  N_corr = correlated particles moving as unit
  γ ~ 1 = quantum-classical boundary
```

This single equation governs superconductivity, chemistry, biology, consciousness, and astrophysics.

### Honest Limitations

- Chemistry melting points: 53% error
- Critical exponents: 2× off from observations
- Environment vs structure ambiguity in NP2
