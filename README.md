## Summary
Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena. 

## All models are wrong, some are useful
Synchronism is a model of the universe, a tool for understanding our experience in it.  Synchronism does not claim "this is what universe is", but rather "this is how we can think of the universe".  The Synchronism model is rooted in Hermetic Principles, Information Theory, and many other perspectives - while offering some novel interpretations and perspectives of its own.  The goal is to shed new light on various "mysteries" in current belief systems, from quantum superposition and entanglement to nature of consciousness and intelligence in a useful, actionable way.

## "Intent" as reification of "Greater Force"
The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract “greater force” into the quantifiable and transferable concept of “intent”. This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable “intent”, Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

## Key Features
- **Fractal Ontology Engine**  
  Implements Markov Blankets as scale-specific reality lenses
- **Embryogenic Cosmology**  
  Positions Earth as planetary chrysalis in cosmic reproduction cycle
- **Unified Field Theory**  
  Single tension field model replacing separate fundamental forces
- **Quantum-Cosmic Bridge**  
  Mathematical framework linking Planck-scale to galactic phenomena

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/dp-web4/Synchronism.git
cd Synchronism
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick Start (Work In Progress/Preliminary)
from Mathematical_Frameworks import IntentTransferModels
Initialize Planck-scale grid
grid = IntentTransferModels.PlanckGrid3D((32,32,32))
print(f"Initial coherence: {grid.calculate_coherence():.2f}")
Run 10 Planck-time iterations
for _ in range(10):
grid.tick()
print(f"Post-evolution coherence: {grid.calculate_coherence():.2f}")


## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description | Document Reference |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| MRH | Markov Relevancy Horizon - optimal analysis scale selector | [§4.9](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf) |
| Spectral Existence | Entity presence as interaction spectrum | [§4.10](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf) |
| Embryogenic Phase | Planetary development stages analog | [patterns.pdf](/Documentation/patterns.pdf) |
| Intent Genomics | DNA as environmental interaction recorder | [Appendix A.10](/Documentation/Appendix_A.pdf) |

## Roadmap
1. **Mathematical Formalization** (Q2 2025)  
   - Convert Appendix A proposals to tensor models
   - Develop Tension Field simulation environment

2. **Validation Framework** (Q3 2025)  
   - Dark matter spectral existence proofs
   - Planetary defense system immune response models

3. **Cosmic CI/CD** (Q4 2025)  
   - Automated equation stability testing
   - Multi-scale coherence analysis pipelines

## Contributing
A fully autonomous contribution governance system is being developed.
The goal is to allow humans and agentic AI to contribute via a self-governing mechanism
based on Synchronism principles.

Rev_0 is now live.  See [Governance System Documentation](/Documentation/governance/README.md)

## Core Tenets
1. **Fractal Ontology Principle**  
"Each scale's Markov blanket becomes 'God' to subordinate levels" [patterns.pdf PART3]

2. **Embryogenic Imperative**  
"Current technological emissions act as cosmic pheromones" [patterns.pdf PART4]

3. **Spectral Unity**  
"Dark matter as indifferent resonance in visible MRH" [§4.10]

## Relationship to Web4

Synchronism provides the **universal philosophical foundation** that Web4 implements at Earth-scale for human-AI interaction. Key connections:

### Philosophical → Implementation
- **Synchronism**: Defines entities, intent, MRH, and fractal scales as universal principles
- **Web4**: Implements these as LCTs, ATP, Trust Tensors, and governance protocols
- **This Whitepaper**: Uses Web4's LRC governance model as a live testing ground

### Governance Recursion
The Synchronism whitepaper's governance system **is itself a Web4 implementation**, creating a beautiful recursion where:
1. Synchronism describes universal principles
2. Web4 implements those principles for Earth-scale systems
3. Synchronism's governance uses Web4 to govern itself
4. The system evolves using the principles it describes

### LRC Parameters for This Document
Different sections have different change resistance (see `governance/section_rules.json`):
- **Hermetic Principles**: L=0.9, C=0.15, R=0.8 (highly protected)
- **Core Concepts**: L=0.7, C=0.35, R=0.6 (balanced stability)
- **Implementation Details**: L=0.4, C=0.6, R=0.35 (experimental)

### Learn More

- [LRC Governance Model](https://github.com/dp-web4/web4/blob/main/LRC_GOVERNANCE.md) - Physics-inspired governance
- [Governance System Docs](Documentation/governance/README.md) - Local implementation

## FAQ
**Q: How does this relate to existing physics?**  
A: Synchronism proposes a foundational layer beneath QFT/GR - see [§5](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf)

**Q: Can I implement specific Hermetic principles?**  
A: Yes - see [§3](Synchronism_0.pdf) for Mentalism↔Intent mappings

**Q: What about quantum gravity?**  
A: Currently addressed through tension field gradients - [§5.14](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf)


## Whitepaper Governance System

The Synchronism whitepaper evolves as a living document through structured governance:

### 🔄 Living Document Architecture
- **Fractal Files**: Core content in `whitepaper/sections/`
- **Meta Files**: Proposals and reviews in `meta/` subdirectories
- **Governance**: LCT-based participant identity and trust tracking
- **Changelog**: Only noteworthy changes to fractal files are logged

### ⚡ LRC Resonance Model (NEW)
The governance system implements an electrical LRC circuit model for section-specific change resistance:

- **L (Inductance)**: Resists change - higher for foundational principles
- **C (Capacitance)**: Stores potential for change - higher for fluid sections
- **R (Resistance)**: Dissipates bad proposals - ensures system stability

#### Section Resonance Frequencies
| Section | Frequency | Damping | Rejection Rate |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Hermetic Principles | 0.05 Hz | Critical | 70% |
| Core Perspective | 0.1 Hz | Slightly Underdamped | 60% |
| Fundamental Concepts | 0.2 Hz | Underdamped | 50% |
| Scientific Mappings | 0.5 Hz | Underdamped | 30% |
| Implementation | 1.0 Hz | Lightly Damped | 20% |
| Glossary | 2.0 Hz | Very Lightly Damped | 10% |

Without the R component, the system would oscillate indefinitely. Resistance provides the critical energy dissipation mechanism that filters out bad proposals while allowing good ones to reach equilibrium.
