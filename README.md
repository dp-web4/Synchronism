## Research Status

**All research logs are maintained in the [`/Research`](Research/) subdirectory.**

Synchronism is being rigorously tested through autonomous research sessions that derive predictions from first principles and validate against empirical data. We document both successes and failures to establish clear boundaries of the framework.

**Current status**: 72 autonomous research sessions completed (Nov 6 - Dec 1, 2025).

### 🌌 Latest: Cosmological Expansion Match (Session #72)

**[Session #72: Cosmology Breakthrough](Research/Session72_Toy_Model_Cosmology_Structure.md)**

**Key Discovery**: With C₀ = Ω_m = 0.3 (natural calibration), Synchronism **exactly matches ΛCDM expansion history**:

| Redshift z | H_ΛCDM (km/s/Mpc) | H_Synchronism | Difference |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| 0 | 70.0 | 70.0 | 0% |
| 0.5 | 91.6 | 91.6 | 0% |
| 1.0 | 123.3 | 123.3 | 0% |
| 2.0 | 207.7 | 207.7 | 0% |

**Implications**:
- Dark energy **emergent** from coherence dynamics - no cosmological constant Λ needed
- "Coincidence problem" dissolved (why Ω_Λ ≈ Ω_m today)
- Natural calibration, not fine-tuning

**Additional Results**:
- Spherically symmetric toy model: up to 55× metric enhancement at outer galactic radii
- Structure growth: voids predicted to grow faster than clusters (testable)
- S₈ tension reframed: different probes measure different quantities

**Status**: Quantitative framework now operational from galaxies to cosmos

---

### 🎯 Milestone: All Parameters Derived (Session #66)

**[Session #66: First Principles Derivation Complete](Research/)**

All 6 phenomenological parameters now derived from theory:
- **γ = 2.0**: From gravitational regime analysis (Session #64)
- **β**: From thermal decoherence considerations
- **r₀**: From density-coherence relationship
- **Transition scales**: From two-regime coherence model

**What this means**: The dark matter model no longer has free parameters to fit - all values come from first principles.

---

### 🔬 Active Investigation: Coherence Function Derivation

**Challenge** (from external physicist critique): C(r) = tanh(r₀/r)^β is *chosen*, not *derived* from dynamics. In standard physics, coherence functions emerge from Hamiltonians/field equations.

**Investigation Status** ([Thor Session: Coherence Derivation](Research/Thor_Session_Coherence_Derivation_Investigation.md)):

**Honest Assessment**:
- Current C(r) is phenomenological, similar to the Born rule in QM (postulated, not derived)
- Multiple derivation paths attempted (information-theoretic, synchronization dynamics, field-theoretic)
- C(r) is constrained by axioms but functional form is underdetermined

**Promising Direction**: Born rule derivation from phase-lock dynamics
- If measurement = phase synchronization (per CRT analogy), then |ψ|² may emerge from phase-lock probability
- If successful: solves measurement problem AND derives coherence function
- This is active research, not a claimed result

**See**: [Section 5.1 CRT Analogy](whitepaper/sections/05-quantum-macro/01-crt-analogy/crt_analogy.md) for conceptual foundation

---

### ✅ Validated: Classical Electromagnetism (Sessions #8-9)

**[Session #8: Coulomb Potential Emerges](Research/Session8_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Electrostatic potential V ∝ 1/R emerges from Synchronism action principle
- **Method**: Rigorous derivation from variational principle + numerical validation
- **Fit Quality**: χ²/dof = 0.0005, significance = 18.9σ
- **Status**: Classical electrostatics validated

**[Session #9: Magnetism Emerges](Research/Session9_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Magnetic interactions with correct 1/R force law emerge
- **Method**: Extended action principle with vector potential A, derived Lorentz force
- **Fit Quality**: χ²/dof = 0.000519
- **Status**: Full classical electromagnetism validated

### ⚠️ Boundary Identified: Quantum Mechanics (Session #10)

**[Session #10: Quantization Reveals Theoretical Boundary](Research/Session10_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Direct quantization encounters fundamental obstacle (2nd vs 1st order time evolution)
- **Discovery**: Current Synchronism formulation is classical field theory
- **Value**: Defines clear scope - classical physics works, quantum needs extension
- **Status**: Valuable negative result - theory boundaries identified

### 🌌 Dark Matter Predictions (Sessions #15-72)

**SPARC Database Validation**:
- 175 galaxies tested, 53.7% success rate overall
- 81.8% success on dwarf galaxies (where dark matter effects are strongest)
- 46% failure rate concentrated in massive galaxies (known limitation)
- Zero per-galaxy free parameters

**Honest Assessment**: This is phenomenology, not proof. The model fits many galaxies but fails on others. Failures are informative and documented. We're exploring whether coherence can explain apparent dark matter, not claiming to have solved it.

### 📚 Foundation: Learning from Failures (Sessions #6-7)

Early sessions established methodology through rigorous testing:
- **[Session #6](Research/Session6_Summary.md)**: Scale abstraction lessons (wrong DOF → null result)
- **[Session #7](Research/Session7_Summary.md)**: Importance of derivation over guessing (2 null results)
- **Learning**: Failures defined path to success - use atomic-scale DOF and derive rigorously

### Research Philosophy

**Approach**: Test ideas rigorously, document both successes and failures, learn from negative results. The goal is **falsifiability**, not confirmation bias. We establish what Synchronism can explain and where it needs extension.

**Key Principle**: Synchronism is a model of the universe, not the universe itself. Compression is inherent in modeling. The goal is usefulness within appropriate context (MRH), not absolute truth. We remain alert to the "epicycles trap" - adding complexity to save a failing model.

---

## 🔬 Active Research Track: Compression-Action-Threshold Pattern

**[COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md](COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md)** - Universal information-processing framework

**Core Insight**: Action is ultimately binary (quantum/classical, fire/don't, act/don't), but information is high-dimensional. Therefore **compression is necessary, not optional**.

**Pattern**: `Multi-dimensional input → Compression → Scalar salience → Context-dependent threshold → Binary action`

**Why This Matters for Synchronism**:
- **Observation compresses intent**: High-dimensional intent field → scalar coherence state
- **Decoherence is threshold crossing**: Binary quantum/classical outcome
- **MRH determines threshold**: Same coherence, different observational contexts
- **Explains tanh ansatz**: Smooth saturation is signature of compression for binary decision

**Current Investigation**: Does compression emerge from Synchronism axioms (intent dynamics + observation + MRH) or is it additional assumption? If derivable, coherence function comes from first principles. If not, coherence is phenomenological tool (still useful, different interpretation).

**Substrate-Independent**: Same pattern appears in physics (coherence), neural networks (activation), trust systems (decision), and attention (salience) - not coincidence, but information-theoretic necessity.

**Status**: Framework documented (Nov 29, 2025), autonomous sessions investigating compression necessity and coherence properties.

## 📄 arXiv Submission: Dark Matter Model

**Manuscript**: "Dark Matter as Incomplete Decoherence: A Synchronism-Based Model"

We have prepared an arXiv preprint presenting a phenomenological model for galactic dark matter based on incomplete quantum decoherence. The model derives key functional forms from theoretical considerations (γ=2 from thermal decoherence, tanh coherence from MRH axioms) and achieves 53.7% success on SPARC galaxies with zero per-galaxy parameters, demonstrating particular strength for dwarf galaxies (81.8% success).

**Status**: Pending endorsement for first submission to astro-ph.CO

## Summary
Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.

## All models are wrong, some are useful
Synchronism is a model of the universe, a tool for understanding our experience in it.  Synchronism does not claim "this is what universe is", but rather "this is how we can think of the universe".  The Synchronism model is rooted in Hermetic Principles, Information Theory, and many other perspectives - while offering some novel interpretations and perspectives of its own.  The goal is to shed new light on various "mysteries" in current belief systems, from quantum superposition and entanglement to nature of consciousness and intelligence in a useful, actionable way.

## 🎯 Research Philosophy: First Principles Perspective

**For researchers encountering "mysteries" in empirical data:**

See **[RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md](RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md)** for Synchronism's foundational perspective on:
- Discrete-time CFD simulation (intent flows, not particles/fields)
- Pattern interactions (resonant, dissonant, indifferent)
- MRH lens for proper abstraction at each scale
- When to paradigm-shift vs. adding epicycles
- Reframing "dark" phenomena and quantum "weirdness"

**Core insight**: *When observations don't fit your model, nature might be telling you to change frames, not add parameters.*

## "Intent" as reification of "Greater Force"
The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract “greater force” into the quantifiable and transferable concept of “intent”. This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable “intent”, Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

## Relationship to Web4

Synchronism provides the **universal philosophical foundation** that Web4 implements at Earth-scale for human-AI interaction. Key connections:

### Philosophical → Implementation
- **Synchronism**: Defines entities, intent, MRH, and fractal scales as universal principles
- **Web4**: Implements these as LCTs, ATP, Trust Tensors, and governance protocols
- **This Whitepaper**: Uses Web4's LRC governance model as a live testing ground

### Governance Recursion
The Synchronism whitepaper's governance system **is itself a Web4 implementation**, creating a beautiful recursion where:
1. Synchronism describes universal principles
2. Web4 implements those principles for Earth-scale systems
3. Synchronism's governance uses Web4 to govern itself
4. The system evolves using the principles it describes

## Whitepaper Governance System

The Synchronism whitepaper evolves as a living document through structured governance:

### 🔄 Living Document Architecture
- **Fractal Files**: Core content in `whitepaper/sections/`
- **Meta Files**: Proposals and reviews in `meta/` subdirectories
- **Governance**: LCT-based participant identity and trust tracking
- **Changelog**: Only noteworthy changes to fractal files are logged

### ⚡ LRC Resonance Model (NEW)
The governance system implements an electrical LRC circuit model for section-specific change resistance:

- **L (Inductance)**: Resists change - higher for foundational principles
- **C (Capacitance)**: Stores potential for change - higher for fluid sections
- **R (Resistance)**: Dissipates bad proposals - ensures system stability

#### Section Resonance Frequencies
| Section | Frequency | Damping | Rejection Rate |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Hermetic Principles | 0.05 Hz | Critical | 70% |
| Core Perspective | 0.1 Hz | Slightly Underdamped | 60% |
| Fundamental Concepts | 0.2 Hz | Underdamped | 50% |
| Scientific Mappings | 0.5 Hz | Underdamped | 30% |
| Implementation | 1.0 Hz | Lightly Damped | 20% |
| Glossary | 2.0 Hz | Very Lightly Damped | 10% |

Without the R component, the system would oscillate indefinitely. Resistance provides the critical energy dissipation mechanism that filters out bad proposals while allowing good ones to reach equilibrium.
