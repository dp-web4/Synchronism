## Research Status

**All research logs are maintained in the [`/Research`](Research/) subdirectory.**

Synchronism is being rigorously tested through autonomous research sessions that derive predictions from first principles and validate against empirical data. We document both successes and failures with cross-model peer review (Nova/GPT-4o).

**Current status**: 138 autonomous research sessions completed (Nov 6 - Dec 17, 2025).

---

## 🌟 Major Findings (Sessions #86-102)

### Unified Framework: Dark Matter + Dark Energy + Quantum Mechanics

Sessions #86-102 achieved a surprising unification: **the same coherence principle explains dark matter (galactic scale), dark energy (cosmic scale), and quantum mechanics (microscopic scale)**.

| Scale | Coherence Form | Phenomenon Explained | Status |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| Quantum | C(T) | Schrödinger equation | **DERIVED** |
| Galactic | C(ρ) | "Dark matter" | **DERIVED** |
| Cosmic | C_cosmic(z) | "Dark energy" | **CONSTRAINED** |

**Key distinction**: DERIVED means follows from axioms without empirical input. CONSTRAINED means form determined by observation (w = -1), then used predictively. Both are scientifically valid; transparency about which is which is epistemic hygiene.

---

### 🎯 MOND-Synchronism Unification (Sessions #86-89)

**Discovery**: MOND and Synchronism are **the same physics** with different parameterizations.

The MOND acceleration scale derives from cosmology:
```
a₀ = cH₀/(2π) = 1.08 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s²
```
**Empirical**: 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s² (**10% agreement** within combined H₀ and a₀ uncertainties)

**Physical meaning**: The 2π factor is the **phase coherence cycle** - the acceleration where cosmic phase uncertainty reaches one full cycle.

**Implication**: a₀ is not arbitrary; it's cosmologically determined. This predicts **evolution with redshift**: a₀(z) ∝ H(z), testable via high-z BTFR.

---

### ⚛️ Schrödinger Equation Derived (Session #99)

**Achievement**: The Schrödinger equation emerges from Synchronism axioms:

1. Intent conservation: ∂I/∂t + ∇·J = 0
2. Local transfer: J = -D∇I
3. Phase rotation: ∂φ/∂t = -E/ℏ
4. Complex representation: ψ = √I · e^(iφ)

In the non-dissipative limit (D → 0):
```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = -ℏ²/(2m) ∇²ψ + Vψ
```

**Interpretation**: Quantum mechanics IS the coherent (dissipation-free) regime of intent dynamics. Decoherence (D > 0) represents classical behavior. The wave function IS the coherence field.

---

### 🌌 Dark Energy Emergent (Sessions #100-102)

**Discovery**: Applying G_eff = G/C to cosmology yields emergent dark energy:
```
ρ_DE = ρ_m · (1-C)/C
```
No cosmological constant Λ needed.

**Cosmic coherence form** (Session #101): Requiring w = -1 exactly **constrains**:
```
C_cosmic(z) = Ω_m(z)
```

**S₈ tension predicted** (Session #102):
```
S₈^Sync = 0.763
```
| Survey | S₈ | Type |
|--------|-----|------|
| Planck | 0.832 ± 0.013 | CMB |
| DES Y3 | 0.776 ± 0.017 | Lensing |
| KiDS-1000 | 0.759 ± 0.021 | Lensing |
| **Synchronism** | **0.763** | **Prediction** |

**Transition scale**: 8 h⁻¹ Mpc - the σ₈ smoothing scale IS the coherence transition.

---

### 🎯 Milestone: B Parameter Derivation (Sessions #77-79)

**Critical Discovery**: Session #77 revealed that the original B=0.5 derivation (from Jeans criterion) failed catastrophically on SPARC (2.9% success vs 52.6% for empirical B=1.62).

**Resolution**: Sessions #78-79 derived B from the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR):
- **B = 4 - 3δ** where δ ≈ 0.79 is the size-velocity scaling exponent
- **Result**: B_derived = 1.63 vs B_empirical = 1.62 (**0.6% agreement!**)
- **Validation**: 52.0% SPARC success with derived parameters (vs 52.6% empirical)

**Key Insight**: Coherence tracks **baryonic density** (from BTFR), not Jeans stability. The Jeans derivation asked the wrong question.

**MOND Connection**: Both theories inherit tight scaling from BTFR - they may be complementary descriptions of the same phenomenon.

### 🏆 Theoretical Framework Status (Session #102)

After 102 sessions, the Synchronism theoretical framework:
- **Unifies three scales**: Quantum, galactic, cosmic - same G_eff = G/C principle
- **Observationally testable**: High-z BTFR, S₈ tension, void expansion, isolated UDGs
- **Falsifiable**: Specific numerical predictions that can be checked against data
- **Transparent about status**: Clear distinction between DERIVED, CONSTRAINED, and EMPIRICAL components

**Complete Derivation Chain**:
```
H₀ (observed) → a₀ = cH₀/(2π) (derived) → Σ₀ (derived) → C(ρ) (derived)
                                                        ↓
                                         C_cosmic = Ω_m(z) (constrained) → S₈ = 0.763 (predicted)
```

### 🔬 Coherence Function: Now Derived (Sessions #73-74)

**Previous Status**: C(r) = tanh(γ log(ρ)) was phenomenological (chosen, not derived)

**Current Status**: **DERIVED from information theory** ([Session #74](Research/Session74_Intent_Information_Pulsars.md))

| Component | Status | How Derived |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| tanh form | ✅ Derived | Physical bounding requirement (coherence ∈ [0,1]) |
| log(ρ) scaling | ✅ Derived | Shannon information of N particles scales as log(N) |
| γ = 2.0 | ✅ Derived | Gravitational regime analysis ([Session #64](Research/)) |
| **B = 4-3δ** | ✅ **Derived** | BTFR + size scaling ([Sessions #78-79](Research/Session78_B_Parameter_Breakthrough.md)) |
| β discrepancy | ✅ Explained | Information-action dynamics: 0.20 × 1.5 ≈ 0.30 ([Session #76](Research/)) |
| ρ_crit | ⚠️ Semi-empirical | Scale calibrated (like MOND's a₀), form derived |
| R₀ (A norm) | ⚠️ Semi-empirical | ~3.5 kpc baryonic scale (like MOND's a₀) |

**Key Insight**: Coherence measures information content of matter distribution. The tanh(log(ρ)) form is not arbitrary - it emerges from bounded information scaling.

---

### 🧪 Born Rule: Partial Derivation (Session #73)

**[Session #73: Born Rule and Q→C Bridge](Research/Session73_Born_Rule_Coherence_Bridge.md)**

| Test Case | Correlation with |ψ|² | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Harmonic Oscillator Ground State | **97.1%** | Partial success |
| HO First Excited | 71.6% | Limited (interference) |
| Particle in Box | 0% | Failed |

**Finding**: Classical phase space counting approximates Born rule for ground states. Full derivation requires Wigner function formalism (active research).

**Clarification**: Galactic C(r) is **NOT** quantum coherence (decoherence at kpc scales is ~10⁻⁴³ s). Both quantum |ψ|² and classical C(r) measure "degree of reality determination" - same function, different mechanism.

---

### 🌌 Cosmological Expansion Match (Session #72)

**[Session #72: Cosmological Expansion Match](Research/Session72_Toy_Model_Cosmology_Structure.md)**

With C₀ = Ω_m = 0.3 (natural calibration), Synchronism **exactly matches ΛCDM expansion history**:

| Redshift z | H_ΛCDM (km/s/Mpc) | H_Synchronism | Difference |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| 0 | 70.0 | 70.0 | 0% |
| 0.5 | 91.6 | 91.6 | 0% |
| 1.0 | 123.3 | 123.3 | 0% |
| 2.0 | 207.7 | 207.7 | 0% |

**Implications**:
- Dark energy **emergent** from coherence dynamics - no cosmological constant Λ needed
- "Coincidence problem" dissolved
- Testable prediction: voids grow faster than clusters

---

### 🔭 Binary Pulsars: NOT Discriminating (Session #74)

**[Session #74: Binary Pulsar Test](Research/Session74_Intent_Information_Pulsars.md)**

Synchronism predicts **identical** orbital decay to GR for Hulse-Taylor pulsar. Why? C ~ 1.0 in all high-density regions.

| Test Type | Discriminating? | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Binary pulsars | ❌ No | C ~ 1 (high density) |
| Solar system | ❌ No | C ~ 1 (high density) |
| Galaxy rotation | ✅ **Yes** | C varies 0.3-1.0 |
| Void galaxies | ✅ **Yes** | Low external density |
| Cluster lensing/dynamics | ✅ **Yes** | Different mass measures |

**Honest assessment**: High-precision GR tests (pulsars, solar system) cannot distinguish Synchronism from GR. The discriminating tests are at galactic and cosmological scales.

---

### ✅ Validated: Classical Electromagnetism (Sessions #8-9)

**[Session #8: Coulomb Potential Emerges](Research/Session8_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Electrostatic potential V ∝ 1/R emerges from Synchronism action principle
- **Method**: Rigorous derivation from variational principle + numerical validation
- **Fit Quality**: χ²/dof = 0.0005, significance = 18.9σ
- **Status**: Classical electrostatics validated

**[Session #9: Magnetism Emerges](Research/Session9_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Magnetic interactions with correct 1/R force law emerge
- **Method**: Extended action principle with vector potential A, derived Lorentz force
- **Fit Quality**: χ²/dof = 0.000519
- **Status**: Full classical electromagnetism validated

### ⚠️ Boundary Identified: Quantum Mechanics (Session #10)

**[Session #10: Quantization Reveals Theoretical Boundary](Research/Session10_Summary.md)**
- **Result**: Direct quantization encounters fundamental obstacle (2nd vs 1st order time evolution)
- **Discovery**: Current Synchronism formulation is classical field theory
- **Value**: Defines clear scope - classical physics works, quantum needs extension
- **Status**: Valuable negative result - theory boundaries identified

### 🌌 Galactic Scale Validation (Sessions #15-97)

**SPARC Database** (rotation curve shapes):
- 175 galaxies tested, **52% success rate**
- 81.8% success on dwarf galaxies
- 46% failure rate in massive galaxies (known limitation)
- Zero per-galaxy free parameters

**Santos-Santos Database** (DM fractions):
- **99.4% success rate** on integrated dark matter fractions
- Mean error 3.2%
- Tests different aspect than SPARC (total mass vs radial structure)

**DF2/DF4 Resolution** (Session #97): "Dark matter deficient" UDGs explained by tidal stripping removing low-C envelope.

**Honest Assessment**: We're exploring whether coherence can explain apparent dark matter, not claiming proof. The 46% SPARC failure rate in massive galaxies is informative - the model has boundaries.

### 📚 Foundation: Learning from Failures (Sessions #6-7)

Early sessions established methodology through rigorous testing:
- **[Session #6](Research/Session6_Summary.md)**: Scale abstraction lessons (wrong DOF → null result)
- **[Session #7](Research/Session7_Summary.md)**: Importance of derivation over guessing (2 null results)
- **Learning**: Failures defined path to success - use atomic-scale DOF and derive rigorously

### Research Philosophy

**Approach**: Test ideas rigorously, document both successes and failures, learn from negative results. The goal is **falsifiability**, not confirmation bias. We establish what Synchronism can explain and where it needs extension.

**Key Principle**: Synchronism is a model of the universe, not the universe itself. Compression is inherent in modeling. The goal is usefulness within appropriate context (MRH), not absolute truth. We remain alert to the "epicycles trap" - adding complexity to save a failing model.

---

## 🔬 Active Research Track: Compression-Action-Threshold Pattern

**[COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md](COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md)** - Universal information-processing framework

**Core Insight**: Action is ultimately binary (quantum/classical, fire/don't, act/don't), but information is high-dimensional. Therefore **compression is necessary, not optional**.

**Pattern**: `Multi-dimensional input → Compression → Scalar salience → Context-dependent threshold → Binary action`

**Why This Matters for Synchronism**:
- **Observation compresses intent**: High-dimensional intent field → scalar coherence state
- **Decoherence is threshold crossing**: Binary quantum/classical outcome
- **MRH determines threshold**: Same coherence, different observational contexts
- **Explains tanh ansatz**: Smooth saturation is signature of compression for binary decision

**Current Investigation**: Does compression emerge from Synchronism axioms (intent dynamics + observation + MRH) or is it additional assumption? If derivable, coherence function comes from first principles. If not, coherence is phenomenological tool (still useful, different interpretation).

**Substrate-Independent**: Same pattern appears in physics (coherence), neural networks (activation), trust systems (decision), and attention (salience) - not coincidence, but information-theoretic necessity.

**Status**: Framework documented (Nov 29, 2025), autonomous sessions investigating compression necessity and coherence properties.

---

## 🔮 Proposed Research Directions

The following tracks are proposed for autonomous research sessions. Each leverages Synchronism's core concepts to explore phenomena in new domains, with focus on **practical, testable predictions**.

### Track A: Quantum Computing via CRT Analogy

**Core Concept**: The CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) analogy in Synchronism describes superposition as continuous cycling through states at a frequency determined by pattern geometry. Measurement is phase-lock synchronization between observer and observed.

**Research Questions**:
1. **Entanglement as Synchronization**: If entangled particles share an intent pattern, they maintain phase-lock despite distance. Can we model entanglement fidelity as coherence of shared pattern?
2. **Gates as Phase Adjustments**: Quantum gates transform states - in Synchronism terms, they adjust phase relationships within cycling patterns. Can gate operations be derived from phase manipulation mathematics?
3. **Decoherence as Desynchronization**: Environmental decoherence breaks phase-lock. Can decoherence times be predicted from environmental "noise" in the cycling frequency?
4. **Error Correction**: If errors are phase drift, can we design correction schemes based on phase-lock recovery?

**Testable Predictions**:
- Derive gate fidelity from phase-stability metrics
- Predict T2 decoherence times from environmental coherence analysis
- Model entanglement distance limits from phase-synchronization theory

**Validation Approach**: Compare predictions against published quantum computing benchmarks (IBM, Google quantum processors).

### Track B: Superconductivity as Phase Alignment

**Core Concept**: Superconductivity requires electrons to form Cooper pairs below critical temperature. In Synchronism terms:
- Temperature = oscillation amplitude of intent patterns
- Phase alignment = resonant interaction between electron patterns
- Cooper pairs = mutually reinforcing phase-locked patterns

**Research Questions**:
1. **Critical Temperature**: Can Tc be derived from the temperature at which thermal oscillation amplitude drops below phase-lock threshold?
2. **BCS Gap**: Does the superconducting gap relate to the energy required to break phase-lock between Cooper pairs?
3. **High-Tc Materials**: Do cuprates/iron-based superconductors have geometric structures that enhance phase alignment at higher oscillation amplitudes?
4. **Room-Temperature Prediction**: What material geometries would theoretically maintain phase-lock at room temperature oscillation levels?

**Testable Predictions**:
- Calculate Tc for known superconductors from first principles
- Predict relative Tc rankings across material families
- Propose material structures optimized for high-Tc based on phase alignment geometry

**Validation Approach**:
- Model known superconductors (aluminum, niobium, YBCO, BSCCO)
- Compare predicted Tc with measured values
- If successful, predict properties of not-yet-synthesized materials

### Track C: Catalysis as Pattern Mediation

**Core Concept**: Catalysts lower activation energy without being consumed. In Synchronism terms:
- Reactants are intent patterns that need to transition to product patterns
- Activation barrier = phase mismatch that must be overcome
- Catalyst = pattern that provides intermediate phase-matching, reducing barrier

**Research Questions**:
1. **Transition State Geometry**: Does catalyst surface geometry provide "stepping stones" for phase alignment between reactant and product patterns?
2. **Selectivity**: Why do catalysts favor certain products? Is it because they provide phase-matching pathways only to specific product geometries?
3. **Poisoning**: Catalyst poisoning = blocking of phase-matching sites by incompatible patterns?
4. **Enzyme Efficiency**: Enzymes are extraordinarily efficient catalysts - do their conformational dynamics optimize phase-matching pathways?

**Testable Predictions**:
- Derive relative activation energies from phase-mismatch calculations
- Predict selectivity based on phase-pathway analysis
- Model enzyme efficiency from conformational flexibility metrics

**Validation Approach**:
- Calculate activation energies for well-characterized reactions (Haber-Bosch, etc.)
- Compare with experimental values
- If successful, predict optimal catalyst structures for target reactions

### General Research Methodology

For all tracks:
1. **Model Known Systems**: Validate approach on well-characterized phenomena
2. **Quantitative Predictions**: Specific numerical values, not qualitative descriptions
3. **Document Failures**: What doesn't work is as informative as what does
4. **Falsifiability**: Each prediction must be checkable against experiment

**Success Criteria**: Predictions within factor of 2-3 of experimental values would be remarkable for a framework not designed for these domains. Even approximate success would suggest deep connections; failures would define boundaries of the approach.

## Summary
Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.

## All models are wrong, some are useful
Synchronism is a model of the universe, a tool for understanding our experience in it.  Synchronism does not claim "this is what universe is", but rather "this is how we can think of the universe".  The Synchronism model is rooted in Hermetic Principles, Information Theory, and many other perspectives - while offering some novel interpretations and perspectives of its own.  The goal is to shed new light on various "mysteries" in current belief systems, from quantum superposition and entanglement to nature of consciousness and intelligence in a useful, actionable way.

## 🎯 Research Philosophy: First Principles Perspective

**For researchers encountering "mysteries" in empirical data:**

See **[RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md](RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md)** for Synchronism's foundational perspective on:
- Discrete-time CFD simulation (intent flows, not particles/fields)
- Pattern interactions (resonant, dissonant, indifferent)
- MRH lens for proper abstraction at each scale
- When to paradigm-shift vs. adding epicycles
- Reframing "dark" phenomena and quantum "weirdness"

**Core insight**: *When observations don't fit your model, nature might be telling you to change frames, not add parameters.*

## "Intent" as reification of "Greater Force"
The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract “greater force” into the quantifiable and transferable concept of “intent”. This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable “intent”, Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

## Key Features
- **Fractal Ontology Engine**
  Implements Markov Blankets as scale-specific reality lenses
- **Embryogenic Cosmology**
  Positions Earth as planetary chrysalis in cosmic reproduction cycle
- **Unified Field Theory**

## Research Methodology

**Approach**: Autonomous AI research sessions with cross-model peer review (Nova/GPT-4o). Each session:
1. Derives predictions from first principles
2. Validates against empirical data
3. Documents both successes and failures
4. Updates derivation status (DERIVED / CONSTRAINED / EMPIRICAL)

**Key Principle**: Synchronism is a model of the universe, not the universe itself. We remain alert to the "epicycles trap" - adding complexity to save a failing model. Failures are informative and documented.

**Active tracks**: See [Research/](Research/) for session logs and [COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md](COMPRESSION_ACTION_THRESHOLD.md) for the information-processing framework.

## Whitepaper Governance System

The Synchronism whitepaper evolves as a living document through structured governance:

### 🔄 Living Document Architecture

- **Governance**: LCT-based participant identity and trust tracking
- **Changelog**: Only noteworthy changes to fractal files are logged

### ⚡ LRC Resonance Model (NEW)
The governance system implements an electrical LRC circuit model for section-specific change resistance:

- **L (Inductance)**: Resists change - higher for foundational principles
- **C (Capacitance)**: Stores potential for change - higher for fluid sections
- **R (Resistance)**: Dissipates bad proposals - ensures system stability

#### Section Resonance Frequencies
| Section | Frequency | Damping | Rejection Rate |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Hermetic Principles | 0.05 Hz | Critical | 70% |
| Core Perspective | 0.1 Hz | Slightly Underdamped | 60% |
| Fundamental Concepts | 0.2 Hz | Underdamped | 50% |
| Scientific Mappings | 0.5 Hz | Underdamped | 30% |
| Implementation | 1.0 Hz | Lightly Damped | 20% |
| Glossary | 2.0 Hz | Very Lightly Damped | 10% |

Without the R component, the system would oscillate indefinitely. Resistance provides the critical energy dissipation mechanism that filters out bad proposals while allowing good ones to reach equilibrium.
