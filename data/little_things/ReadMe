Abstract:
    We use a compilation of disc galaxy rotation curves to assess the role
    of the luminous component ('baryons') in the rotation curve diversity
    problem. As in earlier work, we find that rotation curve shape
    correlates with baryonic surface density: high surface density
    galaxies have rapidly rising rotation curves consistent with cuspy
    cold dark matter haloes; slowly rising rotation curves (characteristic
    of galaxies with inner mass deficits or 'cores') occur only in low
    surface density galaxies. The correlation, however, seems too weak to
    be the main driver of the diversity. In addition, dwarf galaxies
    exhibit a clear trend, from 'cuspy' systems where baryons are
    unimportant in the inner mass budget to 'cored' galaxies where baryons
    actually dominate. This trend constrains the various scenarios
    proposed to explain the diversity, such as (i) baryonic inflows and
    outflows during galaxy formation; (ii) dark matter self-interactions;
    (iii) variations in the baryonic mass structure coupled to rotation
    velocities through the 'mass discrepancy-acceleration relation'
    (MDAR); or (iv) non-circular motions in gaseous discs. Together with
    analytical modelling and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, our
    analysis shows that each of these scenarios has promising features,
    but none seems to fully account for the observed diversity. The MDAR,
    in particular, is inconsistent with the observed trend between
    rotation curve shape and baryonic importance; either the trend is
    caused by systematic errors in the data or the MDAR does not apply.
    The origin of the dwarf galaxy rotation curve diversity and its
    relation to the structure of cold dark matter haloes remains an open
    issue.

Description:
    Our compilation of rotation curves from the literature includes data
    sets from the Spitzer Photometry & Accurate Rotation Curves project
    (SPARC; Lelli et al. 2016AJ....152..157L, Cat. J/AJ/152/157); from The
    HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS; de Blok et al. 2008AJ....136.2648D);
    from the Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The HI
    Nearby Galaxy Survey (LITTLE THINGS ; Oh et al. 2015AJ....149..180O);
    as well as from the work of Adams et al. (2014ApJ...789...63A) and
    Relatores et al. (2019ApJ...873....5R).

    All rotation curves in this compilation were inferred from
    high-resolution HI and/or H{alpha} velocity fields, and include
    asymmetric drift corrections when needed. In all cases the velocity
    field data has been combined with photometry to construct mass models
    that include the stellar, gaseous, and dark matter components. In
    particular, the SPARC, THINGS, and LITTLE THINGS data make use of
    Spitzer 3.6{mu}m surface photometry, while Adams et al.
    (2014ApJ...789...63A) and Relatores et al. (2019ApJ...873....5R) use
    r-band images from a variety of sources. If the same galaxy is common
    to more than one survey, we adopt the SPARC data, because the majority
    of galaxies in our sample come from that compilation.
