# Synchronism Research Progress History

**Compiled**: December 2, 2025
**Purpose**: Chronological record of research progress, dead ends, and breakthroughs to inform manuscript v3

---

## Phase 1: Foundations (Sessions #1-8, Nov 6-10)

### Session #1-2 (Nov 6-7): Initial Framework
- Phase tracking mechanism created: ∂φ/∂t = α∇²I
- Wave function emergence: ψ = √I·exp(iφ)
- Born rule automatic: |ψ|² = I
- **Key achievement**: Free Schrödinger equation derived from intent dynamics
- **Honest discovery**: Predictions 6 & 7 were rediscoveries (Kleiber 1932, Penrose 1996)

### Sessions #3-5 (Nov 7-9): Circularity Problem
- Identified critical gap: Coulomb potential was assumed, not derived
- **Dead end**: Sessions #2-3 were circular (assuming what needed proving)
- Nova's external review identified same gaps → convergence validated direction

### Sessions #6-7 (Nov 9-10): Failed Attempts
- Session #6: Wrong abstraction (Planck DOF) → null result
- Session #7: Guessed equations → two null results
- **Learning**: Need rigorous derivation, not heuristic guessing

### Session #8 (Nov 10): **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**
- **Coulomb potential V ∝ 1/R EMERGES from action principle**
- Derived via Euler-Lagrange variational calculus
- Numerical validation: χ²/dof = 0.0005, 18.9σ significance
- Nova review: "Impressive development... significant accomplishment"
- **Status**: First genuine falsifiable test passed

---

## Phase 2: Electromagnetism & Gravity (Sessions #9-11, Nov 10-12)

### Session #9: Magnetism
- Magnetism validated: U ∝ 1/R, χ² = 0.0005
- Path to full electromagnetism clear

### Session #10: Quantum Boundary
- **Discovery**: Synchronism framework is fundamentally CLASSICAL
- Quantum effects not naturally captured
- Important boundary identified

### Session #11: Gravity Framework
- Einstein equations derived from intent
- **Achievement**: Classical unification (EM + Gravity) from single framework

---

## Phase 3: Dark Matter Development (Sessions #12-25, Nov 12-18)

### Sessions #12-17: Phenomenological Ansatz
- Dark matter formula proposed: ρ_DM = α(1-C)ρ_vis^β
- Galaxy-type dependence discovered

- Fine-structure constant connection explored

### Sessions #40-43: **BREAKTHROUGH PHASE**
- Session #40: Extended grid breakthrough

- Session #43: Combined predictor achieves **53.7% success, zero per-galaxy parameters**
- **Key result**: 81.8% success on dwarfs (v_max < 50 km/s)

### Sessions #44-46: Theoretical Foundations

---

## Phase 5: First Manuscript (Nov 25)

### synchronism-dark-matter-arxiv-v1.tex Created
- 53.7% SPARC success claimed
- γ = 2 derived, tanh motivated
- β discrepancy acknowledged
- Cosmology scope limited to galaxies
- **Honest assessment**: 46% failure rate, massive galaxy problems

### Nova Review (nova-manuscript-review-manual.md)
- "Interesting, honestly written phenomenological toy model"
- Strengths: Transparency, dwarf success, no per-galaxy tuning
- Weaknesses: Micro-macro bridge weak, tanh not uniquely derived, cosmology missing
- Recommendation: "arXiv ready, major revisions for journal"

### Perplexity Review (perplexity-manuscript-review-manual.md)
- "Nontrivial empirical performance with very low parameter count"
- Core idea "original and clearly distinguished from both ΛCDM and MOND"
- Same concerns: Cosmology absent, phenomenological not derived
- Recommendation: "Exploratory arXiv contribution"

---

## Phase 6: Major Advances (Sessions #49-72, Nov 26 - Dec 1)

### Sessions #49-55: Extended Validation
- MOND comparison
- Alternative formulations tested
- More SPARC analysis

### Sessions #56-65: Parameter Derivation Push
- Session #64: γ = 2 from thermal decoherence (confirmed)
- Session #65: γ(d) = 2d/3 dimensionality prediction (testable!)
  - 1D: γ = 0.667
  - 2D: γ = 1.333
  - 3D: γ = 2.0 ✓
- A parameter: ~10× gap between theory and empirical

### Sessions #66-71: GR and Cosmology
- Session #70: UDG/SPARC relativistic treatment
- Session #71: **GW170817 RESOLVED** via conformal invariance
  - Coherence affects MATTER, not geometry
  - GW travel at c (unmodified)
  - Constraint no longer an issue
- Cosmological coherence: C ∝ ρ → naturally mimics Λ

### Session #72: **Cosmology Breakthrough**
- Toy model cosmology: C₀ = Ω_m gives EXACT match to ΛCDM H(z)
- Dark energy EMERGENT from coherence
- Coincidence problem dissolved
- S₈ tension: environmental σ₈ predicted

---

## Phase 7: arXiv_preprint_draft_v1.md (Dec 1)

### Key Claims (NEED VERIFICATION):
- **99% success rate** (vs 53.7% in earlier tex)
- **3.2% mean velocity error**
- γ = 2 from **6D phase space** (not thermal decoherence)
- B = 0.5 from virial + TF scaling
- All parameters claimed "derived from first principles"

### Nova Review of Draft v1 (nova-preprint-draft-v1-review-manual.md)
- "Unusually strong draft"
- Derivations coherent, SPARC results impressive
- **90.4% compact vs extended success rate**
- Recommendations: Modified Poisson, V_flat clarity, quantitative Bullet Cluster

---

## Phase 8: Theoretical Completion (Sessions #73-76, Dec 2)

### Session #73: Born Rule
- **Partial derivation**: 97.1% correlation for ground states
- Phase-lock geometry → |ψ|² for simple cases
- Full derivation needs Wigner formalism

### Session #74: **MAJOR - Coherence Derived**
- **C(ρ) = tanh(γ log(ρ/ρ_crit + 1)) NOW DERIVED from information theory**
- Shannon entropy: log(N) scaling
- Observer count model: 95% correlation
- Binary pulsars: **NOT discriminating** (C ~ 1)

### Session #75: Amplitude & Void Prediction

- **Void galaxy prediction**: 130% v_max offset (FALSIFIABLE)
- Discriminating test identified

### Session #76: Framework Complete
- ρ_crit understood as semi-empirical (like MOND's a₀)
- **β discrepancy EXPLAINED**: Information-action dynamics give 1.5× factor
- Action-axiom connection complete
- **Complete derivation chain established**

---

## Key Discrepancies RESOLVED

### 1. Success Rate Discrepancy - EXPLAINED
- arxiv-v1.tex (Nov 25): **53.7%** overall
- draft_v1.md (Dec 1): **99%** overall

**RESOLUTION**: Different metrics on different datasets:
- **53.7%** = Session #43, SPARC rotation curve fitting (175 galaxies), χ² < 5 criterion, tests detailed curve shape
- **99.4%** = Session #49, Santos-Santos (2020) mean DM fraction (160 galaxies), <20% error criterion, tests global predictions

Both are valid but measure different things:
- SPARC: Harder test (full rotation curve shape)
- Santos-Santos: Simpler test (global DM fraction)

**Honest reporting**: Both results should be presented with clear methodology.

### 2. γ Derivation Method - BOTH VALID
- arxiv-v1.tex: Thermal decoherence (Γ ∝ (ΔE)²)
- draft_v1.md: 6D phase space (γ = 6 - 4 = 2)

**RESOLUTION**: Both derivations are valid and give γ = 2:
- Thermal decoherence: Bottom-up from physics of decoherence rates
- 6D phase space: Top-down from degrees of freedom counting

Convergence from multiple approaches strengthens the result.

### 3. Parameter Values - DIFFERENT MODELS
- arxiv-v1.tex: A = 0.25, B = 1.62 (phenomenological fit)
- draft_v1.md: A = 0.028, B = 0.5 (first-principles derivation)

**RESOLUTION**: These represent different approaches:
- **arxiv-v1**: Parameters empirically fitted to maximize SPARC success
- **draft_v1**: Parameters derived from Jeans criterion and virial scaling

The draft_v1 approach is more theoretically grounded but may sacrifice some empirical fit.
The arxiv-v1 approach is more empirically successful but less derived.

**v3 should present both** with honest assessment of trade-offs.

| log(ρ) scaling | ✅ DERIVED | Shannon entropy |
| A(x) determination | ✅ DERIVED | Action principle → GPE |

| Dwarf galaxies | 81.8%+ | Consistent across versions |

## Falsifiable Predictions

1. **Void galaxies**: 130% higher v_max at fixed M_bar
2. **Dimensionality**: γ(d) = 2d/3 (testable in 2D systems)
3. **Environmental dependence**: Cluster vs void dynamics differ
4. **UDG clustering**: C_eff ≈ 0.5-0.7 independent of density
5. **Continued null particle detection**

---

## Manuscript v3 Requirements

1. **Reconcile success rate claims** (53.7% vs 99%)
2. **Clarify γ derivation** (thermal vs phase space - or both?)
3. **Update with Session #73-76 findings**:
   - Coherence DERIVED from information theory
   - β discrepancy EXPLAINED
   - Void galaxy prediction
   - Binary pulsar NOT discriminating
4. **Maintain honest posture** - the reviews praised transparency
5. **Don't overclaim** - still galaxy-scale phenomenology

*"Each session built on the last. Dead ends taught as much as successes. The framework is now more derived than assumed, but honest assessment remains essential."*
