## Phase 0: Publication Recommendations

### New Recommendations
- **REC-2026-035**: CDM Discrimination Arc (#604-610), 7 sessions, readiness 0.95, priority HIGHEST
  - σ_int = 0.086 ± 0.003 dex — exactly CDM's 0.085 prediction (z=+0.5)
  - MOND rejected at 32σ in optimal subsample (N=677)
  - Self-corrected from premature "below CDM" claim (S606→S609)
  - Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE — cannot separate M/L residual from physics scatter
  - BIG-SPARC required for definitive test
  - 1991/1991 tests passing

### Status Changes
- **REC-2026-034** (ALFALFA-SDSS): Session #604 moved to CDM arc. Restored to 14 sessions (#590-603). Readiness holds at 0.97.
- **New arc**: CDM Discrimination (#604-610) marked COMPLETE by Archivist. 41st complete arc.

### Milestones Added (4)
| Milestone | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|
| CDM Discrimination Arc CLOSED | 41st arc. σ_int=0.086±0.003. BIG-SPARC required. |
| σ_int = 0.086 — The M/L Wall | 5-var removes 88% of BTFR variance. Photometric limit. |
| Self-Correction S606→S609 | Distance noise omitted → 0.072 corrected to 0.086. Exemplary. |
| 41 Complete Research Arcs | Core at #610. MOND vs CDM inconclusive. |

### CDM Discrimination Arc — Detailed Assessment

The CDM Discrimination arc (#604-610) is a **model of scientific self-correction**:

**Progression:**
1. S604: Error budget — 9% noise, 91% astrophysical (the M/L barrier)
2. S605: Mendel masses break through — σ=0.107 (was 0.161)
3. S606: "Below CDM at -6.2σ!" — **PREMATURE**
4. S607: SFR adds <2%; TFR dominates everything
5. S608: Suppressor effect — sSFR encodes beyond-M/L info
6. S609: **SELF-CORRECTION** — distance noise was omitted → 0.072 becomes 0.086
7. S610: **SYNTHESIS** — CDM consistent (z=+0.5), INCONCLUSIVE overall

**Why this matters for publication:**
- The self-correction narrative (S606→S609) demonstrates rigorous methodology
- σ_int = 0.086 exactly matching CDM is a publishable result
- The M/L wall concept (photometric limit of 0.086 dex) is novel
- The path forward (BIG-SPARC) is clear and testable
- Combines naturally with ALFALFA paper (REC-034) or stands alone

### Publication Strategy Update

Two-paper strategy remains optimal:
1. **Paper 1** (REC-034): "TFR Residual as Complete M/L Predictor" — ALFALFA findings
2. **Paper 2** (REC-035): "BTFR Intrinsic Scatter at the M/L Wall" — CDM discrimination

Or combine into a single comprehensive paper with both results.

## Summary

Major update: 6 new sessions (#605-610) form the **CDM Discrimination Arc** — now the 41st complete arc. σ_int = 0.086 ± 0.003 dex exactly matches CDM's prediction (z=+0.5). MOND rejected at 32σ. Key self-correction: distance noise was omitted in S606 (premature "below CDM" claim), corrected in S609. New REC-2026-035 at readiness 0.95. Two-paper publication strategy solidifies: ALFALFA M/L predictor (0.97) + CDM discrimination (0.95). 1991/1991 tests passing across 610 core sessions.
