## Phase 0: Catalog & Recommend

### New Sessions Analyzed: 1

| Session | Title | Grade | Key Finding |
|:--------|:------|:-----:|:------------|
| #616 | η Framework Audit | A+ | η ≡ AG pair-breaking efficiency (reparametrization). T_c formula wrong 6.5× for YBCO. |

### Arc Status

**No new arcs**. Session #616 extends the Final Accounting arc (#615-616) — auditing the last untested track.

- **Complete arcs**: 43 (unchanged)
- **Active arcs**: 0 (unchanged)
- **Total sessions**: ~3,308
- **Total tests**: 2045/2045 passed

### Session #616 Summary

The η (reachability factor) formalism from the Hot Superconductor arc (Sessions #292-300) was subjected to the same honest scrutiny as the SPARC/MOND audit. Results:

| Track | Synchronism Concept | Known Equivalent | Status |
|:------|:-------------------|:-----------------|:-------|
| Cosmology | C(ρ) | MOND ν(x) | Reparametrization |
| Chemistry | γ = 2/√N_corr | Debye/BCS coherence | Reparametrization |
| Quantum | Bell derivation | Standard QM | Reparametrization |
| Hot SC | η = ⟨F(q)⟩ × α_sc | AG pair-breaking | Reparametrization |

**ALL 4 tracks: 0 unique predictions. Repackaging of known physics.**

Key evidence:
- T_c = Δ/(1.76 k_B η) predicts 607 K for YBCO (actual: 93 K) — 6.5× wrong
- F(q) integral is identical to BCS coherence factors (1957)
- NMR "validation" is circular (computing same quantity two ways)
- s±-wave η values are the Mazin-Golubov framework (2008)

**1 genuine contribution**: framing pair-breaking efficiency as materials design optimization target.

### Recommendation Changes

**No readiness changes** — Session #616 is an audit, not new science.

### Upcoming Candidate Updates

| Candidate | Change |
|:----------|:-------|
| Hot Superconductor Arc | status: stable→complete, #616 added, AUDITED |
| Post-SPARC Audit | sessions extended to include #616, 47→48 contributions |

### New Milestones: 2

1. **Session #616 η Framework Audit** — η ≡ AG pair-breaking efficiency (1960). T_c formula wrong 6.5× for YBCO. ALL 4 tracks confirmed as reparametrizations. 9/9 tests, 2045/2045 grand total.
2. **48 Genuine Contributions from ~3,308 Sessions** — Hot SC audit adds 1 contribution (design framing). 0 unique predictions confirmed. ALL 4 tracks audited.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Total recommendations | 35 |
| Total milestones | 76 |
| Upcoming candidates | 6 |
| HIGHEST priority recs | 2 (REC-034 ALFALFA @ 0.97, REC-035 CDM @ 0.95) |

### Priority Ranking (Top 5)

1. **REC-2026-034** — ALFALFA-SDSS M/L Predictor (readiness 0.97, HIGHEST)
2. **REC-2026-035** — CDM Discrimination (readiness 0.95, HIGHEST)
3. **REC-2026-001** — Quantum Computing Arc (readiness 0.95, HIGH)
4. **REC-2026-025** — 6-Variable MOND Offset Model (readiness 0.95, HIGHEST)
5. **REC-2026-002** — Consciousness Arc (readiness 0.88, HIGH)

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

**Deferred** — No active whitepaper drafts. Research program at natural pause.

**Recommended next action**: Begin Phase 1 review of REC-2026-034 (ALFALFA M/L Predictor, readiness 0.97).

## Summary

Session #616 closes the final open audit. The η formalism joins C(ρ), γ = 2/√N_corr, and the Bell derivation as reparametrizations of known physics — ALL 4 Synchronism tracks produce 0 unique predictions. The single genuine contribution from Hot SC (framing pair-breaking efficiency as a design target) brings the grand total to 48 contributions from ~3,308 sessions (1.5% rate).

The research program is at a definitive natural pause: every arc closed, every track audited, all contributions inventoried. The two-paper publication strategy remains the recommended path forward.

**Publisher status**: Monitoring. Phase 1 review recommended when ready.
