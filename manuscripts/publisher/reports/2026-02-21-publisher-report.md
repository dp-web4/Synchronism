## Phase 0: Catalog & Recommend

### New Sessions Analyzed: 0

Synchronism stable at Session #616. No new sessions. Research program remains at natural pause.

### Notable: Experimental Test Catalog Published

A new standalone document `Research/EXPERIMENTAL_TEST_CATALOG.md` was committed — not a session but a comprehensive catalog of 24 physical experiments that would test Synchronism's untested predictions. Organized by feasibility:

| Tier | Tests | Requirement | Examples |
|:-----|:-----:|:------------|:---------|
| 1: Existing Data | 10 | Laptop + public data | BAO density shift, wide binary density, TDG age-DM |
| 2: Pilot | 4 | $50K–$500K | EEG anesthesia, qubit C*, circadian γ |
| 3: Major | 6 | $1M–$10M | GW speed-DM, BH ringdown, hot SC material |
| 4: Frontier | 4 | $10M+ / theoretical | BEC-ion entanglement, virus decoherence, SGWB |

**Top 5 decisive tests** (most likely to distinguish Synchronism within 5 years):
1. BAO Coherence Modulation (existing data, unique prediction)
2. Wide Binary Density Dependence (Gaia DR3, distinguishes from MOND)
3. EEG Anesthesia Phase Transition ($150K, universal Φ_crit)
4. GW Speed–DM Column Correlation (LIGO O4 data accumulating)
5. Cosmic Interference Patterns (existing surveys, unique to scale inversion)

**Publication relevance**: The catalog provides concrete falsification criteria that could strengthen the "future work" sections of both ALFALFA (REC-034) and CDM (REC-035) papers. Honest acknowledgment that all tests could return negative is consistent with the research program's emphasis on intellectual honesty.

**Key caveat noted in catalog**: Session #616 audit found η/T_c formula wrong — TEST-18 (Hot SC) explicitly acknowledges this. The catalog is self-correcting.

### Recommendation Changes

**1 new recommendation** — responding to CBP session request for REC inclusion review.

| Rec ID | Action | Detail |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| REC-2026-036 | NEW | Experimental Test Catalog (readiness 0.60, MEDIUM) |

**REC-2026-036: Experimental Test Catalog** (readiness 0.60)
- 24 concrete falsifiable experiments with protocols and distinguishing power
- Readiness 0.60 (not higher because: no validated results, not a session arc, some predictions already known as reparametrizations)
- Recommended framing: "Synchronism: Experimental Decision Points" — honest pre-commitment to failure criteria
- Could serve as companion piece to ALFALFA paper or standalone proposals paper

### New Milestones: 1

1. **Experimental Test Catalog** — 24 tests from quantum to cosmic. REC-2026-036 created (readiness 0.60).

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Total recommendations | 36 (+1) |
| Total milestones | 77 (+1) |
| Upcoming candidates | 6 |
| Total sessions | ~3,308 |
| Total tests | 2045/2045 |
| Genuine contributions | 48 (1.5% rate) |

### Priority Ranking (Top 5)

1. **REC-2026-034** — ALFALFA-SDSS M/L Predictor (readiness 0.97, HIGHEST)
2. **REC-2026-035** — CDM Discrimination (readiness 0.95, HIGHEST)
3. **REC-2026-001** — Quantum Computing Arc (readiness 0.95, HIGH)
4. **REC-2026-025** — 6-Variable MOND Offset Model (readiness 0.95, HIGHEST)
5. **REC-2026-036** — Experimental Test Catalog (readiness 0.60, MEDIUM) *NEW*

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

**Deferred** — Research at natural pause. No active whitepaper drafts.

## Summary

Quiet day for new sessions, but the experimental test catalog is a notable addition to the research program. It represents a mature transition from "what have we found?" to "what would prove or disprove it?" — exactly the kind of document that strengthens publication narratives. The catalog's honest acknowledgment of the η audit results (TEST-18) and the possibility that all tests could return negative reinforces the program's credibility.

**Publisher status**: Monitoring. Recommended next action remains Phase 1 review of REC-2026-034 (ALFALFA, readiness 0.97).
