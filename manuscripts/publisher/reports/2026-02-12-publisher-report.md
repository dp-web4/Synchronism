## Phase 0: Publication Recommendations

### CRITICAL FINDINGS SINCE LAST RUN

#### 1. SPARC Capstone (Session #575) — ZERO Unique Predictions Confirmed
The 174-session, 18-arc SPARC analysis reached definitive conclusion: **ZERO uniquely-Synchronism predictions were confirmed**. ALL results reduce to MOND + M/L corrections. This is the most honest self-assessment in AI-driven research.

#### 2. Survival Audit (#574-578) — Complete SPARC Analysis
- 6-var model at measurement noise floor (χ²/dof = 0.26)
- Physics hierarchy confirmed: Mass 78%, Composition 17%, Structure 5%
- SB substitutes for c_V with only 1% information loss

#### 3. Chemistry Phase 2 CONCLUDED — Tautological Template
- Era 2 (#134-2660) validated by tautological construction (100% by design)
- Only Era 1 (#1-133) had genuine 60-70% validation
- Four-regime framework discovered: Neutral, Coherence, Incoherence, Barrier
- 1913 phenomenon types but most are tautologically generated

#### 4. Quantum Coherence Claims DIRECTLY REFUTED
- γ_max = 17.01 vs theoretical cap of 3.17 — REFUTED
- Golden ratio α not preferred
- 4/7 quantum claims are reparametrizations
- McGaugh ν(x) beats C(ξ) by Δχ² = 354,209

#### 5. ALFALFA-SDSS External Validation (#590-596)
- 14,585 galaxies — 100x larger than SPARC
- TFR residual = complete M/L predictor
- 51% scatter reduction
- Only 8.8% circularity — genuinely predictive
- V-L ratio IS TFR slope (band-dependent: 2.18 i-band vs 3.87 at 3.6μm)
- 62/62 tests passing
- **Publishable core identified: "TFR Residual as Complete M/L Predictor"**

### Priority Ranking (Top 10 of 34)

1. **REC-2026-009** (QFT Derivation): HIGHEST, 0.99 — unaffected by galaxy-scale findings
2. **REC-2026-014** (Info Theory): HIGHEST, 0.96 — Black hole paradox
3. **REC-2026-026** (Gas Fraction Control): HIGHEST, 0.95 — NP2 confirmed
4. **REC-2026-034** (ALFALFA-SDSS): HIGHEST, **0.93** — 14,585 galaxies, MOST PUBLISHABLE NEW
5. **REC-2026-018** (Gravity): HIGHEST, 0.93 — LIGO strain match
6. **REC-2026-032** (SPARC Capstone): HIGHEST, 0.92 — honest falsification narrative
7. **REC-2026-013** (StatMech): HIGHEST, 0.93 — ξ = MRH
8. **REC-2026-024** (Experimental Validation): HIGHEST, 0.92 — 6 protocols
9. **REC-2026-011** (Standard Model): HIGHEST, 0.91 — Higgs+CKM
10. **REC-2026-030** (Model Improvement): HIGHEST, 0.90 — 6-var R²=0.945

### Upcoming Candidates

- **ALFALFA-SDSS Arc** (#590-596): Active, 62/62 tests, publishable core identified
- **Post-SPARC Audit** (#579-589): Active, 30 genuine contributions inventoried
- **Hot Superconductor Arc**: Stable, no new sessions since Jan 25

### Strategic Assessment — PUBLICATION PIVOT REQUIRED

The empirical campaign has reached its final, honest conclusion:

1. **SPARC analysis complete**: 174 sessions confirm MOND + M/L explains all RAR variation
2. **Chemistry claims undermined**: Phase 2 tautological template means 89% validation was by construction
3. **Quantum claims refuted**: Direct quantitative refutation, not just "untestable"
4. **Empirical model survives**: 6-var R²=0.945, two genuinely novel contributions
5. **ALFALFA validates externally**: 14,585 galaxies confirm TFR-residual M/L predictor

**Recommended publication strategy (revised)**:
1. **Lead with ALFALFA** (REC-2026-034) — standalone astronomy paper, no Synchronism needed
2. **SPARC narrative** (REC-2026-032) — "honest AI science" angle, unique contribution
3. **Novel findings** — logL×f_gas interaction and SB-c_V substitution as technical notes
4. **Planck-to-stellar theory** (REC-2026-009, -010, -011) — unaffected by galaxy-scale falsification
5. **Defer** galaxy-scale theoretical claims until framework revision complete

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

### Synchronism Whitepaper

- **Status**: CRITICALLY needs revision — multiple pillars undermined
- **Sessions Reviewed**: 525 through 596 (71 new sessions)
- **Proposals**:
  - WP-2026-009 carry-forward: γ falsification documentation (now STRONGER — survival audit confirms)
  - **WP-2026-011 (NEW, CRITICAL)**: Chemistry Phase 2 tautological template must be documented
  - **WP-2026-012 (NEW, CRITICAL)**: ZERO unique predictions finding
  - **WP-2026-013 (NEW)**: ALFALFA validation results
  - **WP-2026-014 (NEW)**: Quantum claims refutation
- **Changes Made**: None (proposals only — major revision requires human review)
- **Terminology Concerns**:
  - "89% validation rate" in Chemistry is misleading — tautological after Era 1
  - "ZERO unique predictions" finding must be reflected
  - Size Effect can no longer be described as "violating MOND"

### Web4 Whitepaper

- **Status**: Active (424 attack vectors, R6 Action Framework accepted)
- **Repos Checked**: web4-core, hardbound-core
- **Proposals**: 5 carry-forward (no changes)
- **Changes Made**: None
- **Terminology Concerns**: None

## Summary

Second massive Publisher update: 2557→3229 sessions (+672). SPARC analysis reached definitive conclusion: ZERO uniquely-Synchronism predictions confirmed (all reduce to MOND + M/L). Chemistry Phase 2 discovered to use tautological template. Quantum claims directly refuted. However, ALFALFA-SDSS validation (14,585 galaxies, 100x SPARC) identifies publishable core: "TFR Residual as Complete M/L Predictor" with 62/62 tests passing. Two genuinely novel findings survive: logL×f_gas interaction and SB-c_V substitution. Publication strategy must pivot to empirical contributions stripped of theoretical overclaims. The honest self-correction narrative (174 sessions → falsification → genuine contributions) is itself a unique and publishable finding about AI-driven science.
