## Phase 0: Publication Recommendations

### CRITICAL FINDING: γ = 2/√N_corr FALSIFIED

The master equation γ = 2/√N_corr, previously described as "unifying 80 orders of magnitude," has been **FALSIFIED at galaxy scales** during empirical testing with SPARC data:

- **Wrong sign**: r = -0.55 instead of predicted +0.55
- **a₀ artifact**: The a₀ = cH₀/(2π) match is an artifact of fixing interpolation exponent α=0.5
- **Empirical model supersedes**: 6-variable model (R²=0.945) replaces theoretical prediction
- **Impact**: REC-2026-022 (Integration Arc) readiness 0.95→0.80
- **10+ honest failures documented** across the empirical campaign

This represents the research system's most significant self-correction. The theoretical framework at Planck-to-stellar scales is unaffected, but galaxy-scale predictions are invalidated.

### Priority Ranking (Top 10 of 31)

1. **REC-2026-027** (Size Effect): HIGHEST, **0.97** — MOST PUBLISHABLE single finding
2. **REC-2026-009** (QFT Derivation): HIGHEST, 0.99 — unaffected by galaxy falsification
3. **REC-2026-005** (Chemistry): HIGHEST, 0.98 — 1873 phenomena at γ~1
4. **REC-2026-014** (Info Theory): HIGHEST, 0.96 — Black hole paradox
5. **REC-2026-026** (Gas Fraction Control): HIGHEST, 0.95 — NP2 confirmed
6. **REC-2026-010** (GR Derivation): HIGHEST, 0.93 — GW matches
7. **REC-2026-030** (Model Improvement): HIGHEST, 0.94 — 6-var R²=0.945
8. **REC-2026-025** (Empirical Execution): HIGHEST, 0.93 — first real data
9. **REC-2026-013** (StatMech): HIGHEST, 0.93 — ξ = MRH
10. **REC-2026-024** (Experimental Validation): HIGHEST, 0.92 — 6 protocols

### Upcoming Candidates

- **Morphology Split** (Session 525): Active, may extend into multi-session arc
- **Hot Superconductor Arc**: Stable, 5 sessions, no new activity since Jan 25

### Strategic Assessment

The empirical campaign (Sessions 372-525) represents a **paradigm shift** in Synchronism research:

1. **Theory confronted data honestly**: 5+ failures documented, master equation falsified
2. **Empirical model emerged**: 6-variable R²=0.945 model independently valuable
3. **Publication strategy should pivot**: Lead with SIZE EFFECT (REC-2026-027) as standalone astronomy paper, then follow with comprehensive empirical narrative
4. **Framework bifurcation**: Planck-to-stellar theory (QFT, GR, SM arcs) unaffected. Galaxy-scale predictions need revision.

**Recommended flagship paper**: "Galaxy Size Violates the Universal Radial Acceleration Relation in the Deep-MOND Regime" — does NOT require Synchronism framework, appealing to broader audience.

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

### Synchronism Whitepaper

- **Status**: CRITICALLY NEEDS UPDATE — but now complicated by γ falsification
- **Sessions Reviewed**: 371 through 525 (155 new sessions since last review)
- **Proposals**:
  - WP-2026-008 carry-forward: Experimental protocols section (still valid)
  - **WP-2026-009 (NEW, CRITICAL)**: γ = 2/√N_corr falsification at galaxy scales must be documented
  - **WP-2026-010 (NEW)**: Empirical results section (Size Effect, 6-var model, NP2)
  - Integration #005 remains overdue but must now address falsification
- **Changes Made**: None (proposals only — major changes require human review given falsification)
- **Terminology Concerns**:
  - "ONE EQUATION γ = 2/√N_corr" claim must be qualified — galaxy-scale predictions falsified
  - "80 orders of magnitude" claim needs revision
  - Empirical model not yet integrated into terminology

### Web4 Whitepaper

- **Status**: Current (no new developments)
- **Repos Checked**: web4-core, hardbound-core
- **Proposals**: 5 carry-forward (no changes)
- **Changes Made**: None
- **Terminology Concerns**: None

## Summary

LARGEST Publisher update ever: 881→2557 sessions (+1676), 14 new arcs, 7 new recommendations. The CRITICAL finding is γ = 2/√N_corr falsification at galaxy scales (wrong sign). However, the empirical campaign produced independently valuable results: Size Effect (r=-0.489 violates MOND, readiness 0.97), NP2 confirmation (p=5×10⁻⁶), and 6-variable R²=0.945 model. Chemistry expanded from 500 to 2010 sessions (1873 phenomenon types). Publication strategy should pivot to empirical findings while addressing theoretical framework revision. The Size Effect is the single most publishable finding — it's interesting to the broader astronomy community regardless of Synchronism.
