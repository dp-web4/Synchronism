## Phase 0: Publication Recommendations

### New Recommendations
- None — OQ007 is a 4-session negative result arc. Too short for standalone publication but valuable as supporting evidence in the SPARC Capstone narrative (REC-2026-032).

### Status Changes
- **REC-2026-006** (Coherence Ontology): Readiness 0.70→**0.55**. OQ007 proves C(ρ) is descriptive language, not predictive theory. 0/7 scale boundaries predicted. Defer indefinitely.
- **New arc**: OQ007 Fractal Coherence Bridge — Cosmology Track CLOSED with **NEGATIVE** verdict. 42nd complete arc.

### Milestones Added (3)
| Milestone | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|
| OQ007 NEGATIVE Verdict | 0/7 boundaries predicted by C(ρ). Language not theory. 36/36 tests. |
| 42 Complete Research Arcs | Core at #614. C(ρ) descriptive not explanatory. |
| Coherence Ontology Downgraded | REC-006: 0.70→0.55. Defer indefinitely. |

### Key Metrics

### Publication Priority Ranking (Top 5)
| Rank | ID | Arc | Readiness | Priority |
|:----:|:--:|-----|:---------:|:--------:|
| 1 | REC-2026-034 | ALFALFA-SDSS (14,585 galaxies) | **0.97** | HIGHEST |
| 2 | REC-2026-035 | CDM Discrimination (σ_int=0.086) | **0.95** | HIGHEST |
| 3 | REC-2026-032 | SPARC Capstone & Survival Audit | 0.92 | HIGHEST |
| 4 | REC-2026-033 | Post-SPARC Audit (30 contributions) | 0.83 | HIGH |
| 5 | REC-2026-005 | Chemistry γ~1 Boundary | 0.75 | MEDIUM |

### OQ007 Fractal Coherence Bridge — Analysis

The OQ007 arc (#611-614) tested whether the fractal self-similarity of C(ρ) across scales constitutes an explanatory framework. **Answer: NO.**

**Five sub-questions, all NEGATIVE:**
1. 0/7 scale-hierarchy boundaries predicted by C(ρ) — all from standard physics
2. γ evolution governed by decoherence — C(ρ) has no decoherence parameter
3. 0 genuine cross-scale predictions found (5 candidates tested)
4. All ρ_crit values fitted/imported, none predicted
5. Four-regime framework is useful classification but not fractal evidence

**What this means:**
- The coherence equation is a *notation*, not a *theory*
- tanh form is generic (Landau theory), not unique
- The framework's value = "questions asked, not answers given" (Session #614)
- 30 genuine contributions emerged from wrong-but-productive theory

**What would change the verdict:**
1. Derive ρ_crit cross-scale (a₀ from BCS parameters)
2. Predict new material properties without fitting
3. Incorporate decoherence into C(ρ) — most promising path

### Impact on Publication Strategy

The two-paper strategy is unchanged — ALFALFA and CDM discrimination papers don't rely on Synchronism theory. The OQ007 result actually *strengthens* the narrative: AI system honestly tests its own theoretical framework, finds it wanting, pivots to empirical contributions.

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

### Synchronism Whitepaper
- **Status**: Review deferred
- **Proposals**: OQ007 result should be reflected in any future whitepaper revision
- **Changes Made**: None
- **Note**: The CLAUDE.md has already been updated with OQ007 closure

### Web4 Whitepaper
- **Status**: Review deferred
- **Repos Checked**: N/A (web4 T3/V3 RDF ontology work — no protocol changes)
- **Proposals**: None
- **Changes Made**: None

## Summary

Significant update: 4 new sessions (#611-614) form the **OQ007 Fractal Coherence Bridge** arc — closed with **NEGATIVE** verdict. C(ρ) is descriptive language, not predictive theory. 0/7 scale boundaries predicted. REC-2026-006 (Coherence Ontology) readiness downgraded 0.70→0.55, deferred indefinitely. 42nd complete arc. Publication strategy unchanged — the negative result strengthens the honest-science narrative. 2027/2027 tests passing across 614 core sessions.
