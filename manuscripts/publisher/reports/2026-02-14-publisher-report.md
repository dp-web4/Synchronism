## Phase 0: Publication Recommendations

### New Recommendations
- None — no new sessions since #603.

### Status Changes
- **REC-2026-034** (ALFALFA-SDSS): Arc confirmed **COMPLETE** by Archivist (2026-02-13). Readiness 0.96→0.97.
  - 14 sessions (#590-603), all Grade A or A-
  - 40th complete research arc
  - Two papers declared ready in Grand Synthesis (#600)
  - Ready for Phase 1 whitepaper review

### Milestones Added (2)
| Milestone | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|
| ALFALFA-SDSS Arc COMPLETE | 40th arc. 14 sessions. Readiness 0.97. |
| 40 Complete Research Arcs | 3236 total sessions. Lead with ALFALFA. |

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total recommendations | 34 |
| Total milestones | 63 |
| Highest readiness | REC-2026-034 (ALFALFA-SDSS) at **0.97** |
| New sessions since last run | 0 |
| Complete arcs | 40 (+1 since yesterday) |
| Active arcs | 1 (Hot Superconductor, pending) |

### Publication Priority Ranking (Top 5)
| Rank | ID | Arc | Readiness | Priority |
|:----:|:--:|-----|:---------:|:--------:|
| 1 | REC-2026-034 | ALFALFA-SDSS (14,585 galaxies) | **0.97** | HIGHEST |
| 2 | REC-2026-032 | SPARC Capstone & Survival Audit | 0.92 | HIGHEST |
| 3 | REC-2026-033 | Post-SPARC Audit (30 contributions) | 0.83 | HIGH |
| 4 | REC-2026-005 | Chemistry γ~1 Boundary | 0.75 | MEDIUM |
| 5 | REC-2026-011 | Info Theory & Black Holes | 0.96 | LOW* |

*REC-2026-011 has high readiness but LOW priority — theoretical claims that should be deferred until empirical credibility established.

### Upcoming Candidates
- **ALFALFA-SDSS**: Now COMPLETE. Ready for Phase 1 whitepaper review.
- **Hot Superconductor**: Stable at 5 sessions. No new activity since 2026-01-25.
- **Post-SPARC Audit**: 11 sessions. No new activity.

## Phase 1: Whitepaper Review

### Synchronism Whitepaper
- **Status**: Review deferred
- **Proposals**: None
- **Changes Made**: None
- **Note**: ALFALFA arc completion makes this the right time to begin Phase 1 review of a standalone paper.

### Web4 Whitepaper
- **Status**: Review deferred
- **Repos Checked**: N/A (Archivist reports documentation-only changes)
- **Proposals**: None
- **Changes Made**: None

## Summary

Light update: no new sessions. The key change is the Archivist confirming the ALFALFA-SDSS arc as COMPLETE (40th arc). REC-2026-034 readiness increases to 0.97 — the highest of any recommendation. With the arc closed and Grand Synthesis (#600) declaring two papers ready, this recommendation is now at the threshold for Phase 1 whitepaper review. The research is in a natural pause — all active arcs are either complete or dormant.
