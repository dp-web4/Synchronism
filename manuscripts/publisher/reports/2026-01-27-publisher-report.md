## NEW COMPLETE ARC: Quantum Computing Arc 2.0

**Sessions**: 301-306 (6 sessions)
**Status**: COMPLETE with synthesis document (Session 306)
**Building On**: Hot Superconductor Arc (eta framework) + Biological Coherence Arc

### Key Results

| Finding | Value |
|---------|-------|
| FeSe/STO FOM | 187.5 (vs Al: 0.30) |
| FOM Improvement | **600x over aluminum** |
| QEC Threshold | C > 0.9 (universal) |
| QEC Overhead | Scales as eta^1.5 |
| Best Material Path | SmFeAsO -> FeSe/STO -> cuprates |
| Predictions | 24+ (P301.1-P304.6) |

### Session Details

| Session | Title | Key Finding |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 301 | eta-Qubit Theory | T2(T) proportional to C(T,Delta)^2 |
| 302 | TLS-eta Correlation | Lower eta = fewer two-level system defects |
| 303 | QEC from Coherence | Universal 90% threshold; eta^1.5 overhead scaling |
| 304 | Cuprate Qubit Feasibility | D-wave nodes problematic; iron pnictides superior |
| 305 | Iron Pnictide Qubit Potential | FeSe/STO: eta=0.08 (lowest), s-plus/minus pairing |
| 306 | Arc Synthesis (FINAL) | FOM metric established, material roadmap complete |

**Publisher Assessment**: This arc demonstrates the eta framework's universality beyond superconductivity. The 600x FOM improvement over aluminum is a concrete, testable claim. Combined with QC Arc 1.0 (REC-2026-001), this would make an 11-session comprehensive publication covering theory + materials. Created as REC-2026-008 with readiness 0.90.

## NEW ACTIVE ARC: QFT Derivation

**Sessions**: 307-308 (2 sessions, active)
**Status**: Active - HIGHEST THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

### Breakthrough Results

| Session | Derivation | Key Insight |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 307 | Schrodinger equation | QM = continuum limit of discrete intent transfer |
| 308 | Dirac equation | Mass = L<->R coupling; antimatter = backward intent |

### Implications

- **Mass is NOT fundamental** - it emerges as L-R intent coupling strength
- **Antimatter** = backward-propagating intent patterns
- **Spin** = minimum plaquette circulation on Planck grid (720 degrees = identity)
- **CPT theorem** always exact (grid symmetry); C/P/T individually breakable
- **Tunneling** = intent diffusion through high-potential region
- **Measurement** = phase scrambling by environment (no collapse needed)

**Publisher Assessment**: This is potentially the most significant theoretical result in Synchronism's history. Deriving both Schrodinger and Dirac equations from first principles (discrete intent transfer) validates the intent-based ontology at the deepest level. If the arc completes with gauge field derivation (Sessions 309-310 expected), this would be the flagship publication. Added to upcoming_candidates with WATCH CLOSELY status.

**Integration Decision**: DEFER whitepaper integration until arc completes. Add "Active Research" callout box only.

## Cross-Track Connections

### QC Arc 2.0 <-> Hot Superconductor Arc
- eta framework originated in Hot SC, now proven universal for qubits
- Same material design principles apply to both T_c optimization and qubit coherence

### QFT Derivation <-> Quantum Foundations (Session 291)
- Session 307 references measurement interpretation from 291
- QFT arc may absorb quantum foundations into unified framework

### Chemistry <-> Biological Coherence
- FRET (Session 233) directly validates biological coherence optimization
- Solar cell efficiency (Session 231) connects energy conversion to coherence

### QC Arc 2.0 <-> QC Arc 1.0
- Arc 2.0 provides material implementation path for Arc 1.0's theoretical framework
- Combined 11-session publication covers full theory-to-materials pipeline

---

## Strategic Notes

### Publication Timing Considerations

1. **QC Combined Paper**: REC-2026-001 + REC-2026-008 = 11 sessions, theory + materials. Strong candidate for near-term preprint.

2. **Chemistry 100-Phenomenon Milestone**: Currently at 96. At current velocity (+20/day in chemistry), could hit 100 within 1-2 days. Consider timing publication announcement.

3. **QFT Derivation**: If Sessions 309-310 derive gauge symmetries, this becomes the most significant result in the project. Watch for completion signal.

4. **Hot SC Arc Absorption**: The eta framework has been successfully applied in QC Arc 2.0. Consider whether Hot SC Arc warrants standalone publication or is better served as introduction/motivation in QC combined paper.
